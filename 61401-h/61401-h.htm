A RUNAWAY DOG</p>

<small>DON FALLS IN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Don was one of five little puppies. With
his brothers and sisters he cuddled up
close to Mrs. Gurr, the mother dog, to
keep warm, for it was rather cool for little dogs,
even though there was plenty of straw in the
kennel, or house, where they lived. Don shivered
and trembled, but when his mother put
her soft, warm paw over him and the other
little dogs, Don felt better.</p>

<p>Don was such a little puppy that, as yet, his
eyes were not open. I suppose they were made
to stay closed until he grew to be a little
stronger, for the sunlight was very bright outside
of the kennel, and Don might have squinted,
had his eyes been open.</p>

<p>But then Don and his brothers and sisters
did not need to see much when they were so
little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can tell you everything that happens,”
said Mrs. Gurr, the mamma dog. “You little
puppies just stay close together when I go out
to get a bone, or something else to eat, and you
will keep warm, and nothing will happen to you.</p>

<p>“Humm! Humm! Humm!” whined Don.
He really was the largest and strongest of the
litter of puppies, and perhaps that is why he
seemed to come first.</p>

<p>“What’s that you’re saying?” asked his
mother. For you know, doggies have a language
of their own. They cannot speak as we
do, but they can understand when we speak to
them. Dogs are smarter in some ways than we
are. They can understand, and know, what we
say to them, but <em>we</em> can only guess at what they
say, when they bark, growl or whine.</p>

<p>“What’s that you say?” asked Mrs. Gurr, of
Don.</p>

<p>“Humm! Umph! Wee-wee!” went Don.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re cold, are you?” asked Mrs. Gurr,
who had this name because she sometimes made
a noise that sounded that way—“gurr”—away
down in her throat.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m cold,” said Don, shivering.</p>

<p>“Well, cuddle up close to me, and you’ll soon
be warm,” said the mamma dog. So Don, and
his brothers Spot and Prince, and his sisters
Violet and Ruby, crept still closer to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
mother, for she was a big dog, and her hair was
very warm.</p>

<p>For over a week Don and the other little dogs
could see nothing, because their eyes were not
open. They could hear strange noises going on
outside their kennel, but they did not know what
they meant.</p>

<p>Don especially, had many adventures, and
a great many strange things happened to him.
In this book I am going to tell you all about
them, how he ran away, and was locked in a
freight car, and how a bad boy tied a tin can
to his tail—but there—I am getting ahead of my
story. Those things did not happen until Don
grew to be big. So I shall have to start at the
beginning.</p>

<p>And the beginning was when Don still did
not have his eyes open.</p>

<p>Whining, barking just a little, and tumbling
about like little balls of cotton yarn, Don and
the other puppies stayed in the straw in the
kennel with their mother. Sometimes she went
out to get something to eat, and then the little
dogs crept closer to each other to keep warm.
They slept a great deal of the time, for dogs,
like babies, grow when they sleep.</p>

<p>Once, just before Don had his eyes open, he
heard strange noises outside of the kennel house
where he lived. Don did not know what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
noises meant, but I shall tell you what they were.
They were the voices of some boys talking.</p>

<p>“Oh, look at the puppies!” exclaimed one boy.</p>

<p>“What a lot of them,” said another.</p>

<p>“Yes, and they’re all mine,” spoke a third boy.</p>

<p>“Oh, Willie! Can’t I have one?” asked the
first boy, and he reached down in the straw, and
picked up Don. Mrs. Gurr, the mamma dog,
growled a little and whined, for she did not like
strange boys to handle her little puppies.</p>

<p>“You can’t have that one, Charlie,” answered
the boy who had been called Willie.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“Because I promised him to Bobbie Black,”
said Willie. “Bobbie came one day, and picked
that puppy out for his. He’s going to call him
Don, Bob is.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fine dog,” said Charlie, as he gently
put the puppy Don back in the straw again.
“I wish I had one.”</p>

<p>“You can have that one,” said Willie, and he
pointed to Prince.</p>

<p>Of course Don did not understand all this talk,
but his mamma understood. She whined when
she heard Willie talking about giving her puppies
away. Willie was the boy at the house
where the man lived who owned Mrs. Gurr
and the puppies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“When is Bob coming for his dog?” asked
Charlie.</p>

<p>“Oh, as soon as they get their eyes open,”
answered Willie. “That will be in a few days,
now.”</p>

<p>The boys stayed a little longer, and then they
went off to play ball—I mean the boys went off
to play ball for, though puppy dogs can do
many queer things, I never saw any of them play
ball—did you?</p>

<p>Wait, though, if you please. Once, in a circus,
I did see a dog bounce a big, red, rubber ball
about with his nose, but that was not exactly
playing as the boys do, so I suppose it did not
count.</p>

<p>All at once, one day, a very strange thing happened
to Don and the other puppies. Their
eyes were suddenly opened, and the darkness
they had been in so long gave place to light.</p>

<p>Out in front of the kennel was a broad patch
of sunlight, and the straw in the kennel itself
looked like streaks of gold. Up over head was
blue sky, and the green trees waved their
branches.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it all?” asked Don, as he stood
up with his little legs far apart. He had to
stand that way, for he was not very strong as
yet, and, though he tried to stand steadily, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
swayed to and fro as the elephants do in the
circus when they are eating peanuts. “What is
all that which I see?” asked Don, speaking in dog
language, which he understood without being
taught.</p>

<p>“That is part of the world you live in,” said
Mrs. Gurr. “You see the sunshine, the shadows
and the trees.”</p>

<p>“What makes the trees wiggle so?” asked
Prince, who was one of Don’s brothers.</p>

<p>“The wind blows them,” said the mother dog.
“And when you go outside the kennel, and the
wind blows, you must be careful not to get dust
in your eyes. For your eyes are open now, you
know, and if you don’t take care you’ll get things
in them. So watch out when you leave the kennel.”</p>

<p>“Why!” exclaimed Don. “Is there anything
outside of our kennel? I thought this was the
only place there was.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed there are many more places than
this,” said Mrs. Gurr, with sort of a barking
laugh. “This is only a very small part of the
world. You will find it very large when you
start out. I hope you do not get lost.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean—lost?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“Going so far away you cannot find your way
back to the kennel,” said the mother dog.
“When you children are a little older, I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
give you some lessons in how to find your way
home when you go away from it.”</p>

<p>So the days went on, the sun shone warmer
and warmer, and the leaves grew larger on the
trees, for summer was coming. And as the tree
leaves grew, so the little puppy dogs grew, until
they were large enough to run outside the kennel,
and play about on the ground.</p>

<p>They were not very strong on their legs as
yet, and often Don and his brothers and sisters
would tumble and fall, as they raced about, playing
a game something like your game of tag.</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s have a race, Prince,” said
Don one day.</p>

<p>“All right, I will,” answered the other little
puppy dog, and off they started down the gravel
path that led from their kennel.</p>

<p>On they went, faster and faster, turning
around the corner by the house, until, all of a
sudden, they saw a queer little animal in front of
them.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Don, stopping short.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Prince, speaking in
dog language.</p>

<p>“It looks like a puppy,” went on Don, “but it
doesn’t belong to our family. See how big its
tail is, and its back is all humped up. And listen
to what a funny noise it’s making.”</p>

<p>The other animal, on the gravel path, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
hissing like a steam radiator on a cold and frosty
morning.</p>

<p>“Let’s go closer and see what it is,” suggested
Don.</p>

<p>Together he and Prince went up, walking sort
of sideways on their funny, wobbling legs.
Then the queer animal suddenly jumped up in
the air, and Don and Prince felt something sharp
scratch their little black noses.</p>

<p>“Ouch!” whined Prince.</p>

<p>“Wow!” howled Don. “I’m scratched.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go home and tell mamma!” cried
Prince.</p>

<p>Tucking their little tails, like lead pencils,
between their legs, home they wobbled to the
kennel.</p>

<p>“Oh mamma!” barked Don as he saw the
mother dog. “You can’t guess what happened
to us.”</p>

<p>“No!” cried Prince. “We saw another puppy
dog, and his tail was so big! And his back was
all humped up, and he made a funny noise and
stuck something sharp in our noses, and it hurt.”</p>

<p>“That’s what it did!” cried Don, and he
rubbed his nose with his paw.</p>

<p>“Oh, you funny puppy dogs!” exclaimed Mrs.
Gurr. “What you saw was not a little dog.”</p>

<p>“What was it then?” asked Don. “It had
four legs and a tail.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, everything that has four legs and a
tail isn’t a puppy,” said the mother dog. “That
was a cat, and cats almost always scratch dogs,
just as we dogs almost always chase cats.”</p>

<p>“Oh! then if that was a cat we forgot to chase
it!” cried Don. “We didn’t know we had to.
Come on back, Prince, and we’ll chase it.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t need to,” said Mrs. Gurr, the
dog lady. “All dogs don’t chase cats, for some
cats are nice. Besides, you wouldn’t find that
cat now. After this, be more careful, and let
cats alone.”</p>

<p>But Don and Prince thought they knew more
than their mother did, and that afternoon they
started out to find the cat who had made such a
big tail at them, and had scratched them.</p>

<p>They searched all over the garden, Don and
Prince did, for the cat, but they could not find
her. But they had a good time, the two little
puppy dogs did, rolling over in the soft dirt,
pretending to bite each other’s ears, and playing
racing games and tag.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Don said:</p>

<p>“I’m hungry. Let’s go home.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Prince. “We will.”</p>

<p>But when those two little puppy dogs started
off, they could not find their kennel. They did
not know which way to go. First they went one
way, and then another, but the harder they tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the worse it seemed. Though they did not know
it, Don and Prince were lost.</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall we do?” whined Don.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered his brother. “Let’s
go this way.”</p>

<p>Well, they started off a new way, but, all of a
sudden, Don slipped down a bank, and right into
a puddle of muddy water he fell!</p>

<p>“Ouch! Oh! Wow!” howled the little
puppy dog, as he found himself all wet. “Oh,
what is going to happen to us?”</p>

<p>But Don, like nearly all animals, knew what
to do when he fell into the water. He began to
paddle with his little paws, and to swim, for he
did not want to be drowned.</p>

<p>“Oh, can you get out? Can you get out?”
howled Prince, standing on the bank of the
puddle and looking at his brother. It was not
a very large puddle, but it was pretty big for a
little puppy dog.</p>

<p>“Can you get out?” asked Prince.</p>

<p>“I—I guess so! I’m trying hard!” whined
Don, paddling with his paws faster than ever.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>DON’S NEW HOME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Prince, sitting on the bank of the puddle
of water, was howling as loudly as he
could.</p>

<p>“Are you getting out, Don? Are you getting
out?” asked Prince.</p>

<p>“Well, I—I’m trying hard!” answered Don.
“I guess—glub—blulp—gurg!” and then he
could not say anything more, even in dog
language, for his mouth was full of water.</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall I do?” cried Prince.</p>

<p>Don did not have any time to answer him.
He was too busy swimming.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer to the bank of the puddle,
off which he had slipped into the water, swam
Don. He was soon so close that he could put his
paws on the firm earth, and then he knew he was
safe, and could crawl out.</p>

<p>But oh! What a sorrowful looking sight poor
Don was. His nice, clean coat was covered
with muddy water, which dripped down and ran
from him in little puddles.</p>

<p>“Oh, how are you ever going to get dry?”
asked Prince.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Don happened to remember how once
he had seen his mother out in a rain storm. She
came to the kennel quite wet, but before she
went in she shook herself very hard, and the
water drops flew off her in a shower.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’ll do,” thought Don. So he
gave himself as big and as hard a shake as he
could, and the water flew about in a shower.</p>

<p>“Hi! Stop! You’re getting me wet!”
howled Prince.</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean to,” answered Don. “But
that’s the way I get dry. You asked me that,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I didn’t know you were going to put
the water on me,” Prince replied. “I don’t
care, though, as long as you’re safe,” and he went
up to his brother, and kissed him on his nose
with his little red tongue, Prince did, in a way
dogs have.</p>

<p>So Don got safely out of the puddle into which
he had fallen, but his adventures for that day
were not yet at an end.</p>

<p>“Let’s go home,” said Prince. “I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” spoke Don. “But which way is
home?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know?” asked Prince.</p>

<p>“No. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>The two little puppy dogs looked one at the
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot!” cried Don. “Don’t you remember,
we were lost just before I fell in the
puddle, and we’re lost yet. Oh dear!”</p>

<p>Then the two little puppies felt so badly that
they just sat there, on the bank of the mud
puddle, and howled as loudly as they could.</p>

<p>I suppose you wonder what good their howling
did, but I shall tell you.</p>

<p>Back in the kennel Mrs. Gurr, the mother dog,
was waiting and wondering why Don and Prince
did not come home.</p>

<p>“I saw them go over that way,” spoke Violet,
who was nibbling at a bit of puppy cake.</p>

<p>“They were having a race,” said Ruby, who
was practicing at trying to catch her tail.</p>

<p>“Oh, such boys!” cried Mrs. Gurr. “I suppose
they’ve gone so far away they can’t find
their way back. Come, Spot, we’ll go look for
them.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the other brother of Don
and Prince. He was called Spot because he had
a white spot on him. Otherwise he was all
black.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gurr and Spot hurried out of the kennel,
and they had not gone very far before they heard
a noise.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Spot, standing still and
wagging his tail.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said his mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“Howl! Wow! Bur-r-r-r-r!” was the noise
they heard.</p>

<p>“There they are!” said the dog lady. “Those
are your lost brothers calling. Come on, Spot.
I know where they are now.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gurr was very good at finding lost dogs,
and this time she knew just which way to go to
find Don and Prince.</p>

<p>Soon the mother dog saw them sitting on the
edge of the mud puddle, their heads held up in
the air, howling as loudly as they could howl.</p>

<p>“Oh my! What a noise!” cried Mrs. Gurr,
with a dog laugh. “What is the matter with you
puppies, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma! Is that you?” cried Don.
“Oh, we got lost, and—”</p>

<p>“And Don fell in and swam out!” added
Prince.</p>

<p>“Well, that was very smart of him, I’m sure,”
said the mamma dog. “But it was silly of you
to get lost. See, the kennel is only a little way
off, just around that clump of bushes.”</p>

<p>Surely enough, they had been only a little way
off from their home all the while, only they did
not know it.</p>

<p>“But we—we couldn’t find our way home,”
said Don.</p>

<p>“No, and that shows you ought not to go too
far off until you know how to get back,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Mrs. Gurr. “Now as soon as you get dry, Don,
I’ll give you all some lessons in how to find your
way back home again, when you get so far off
you can’t see it.”</p>

<p>It did not take Don long to get dry in the
warm sun, and then the lessons began. For
dogs, even puppy dogs, have to learn their lessons,
you know, just as you children do.</p>

<p>They have to learn to eat only the things that
are good for them. Sometimes a puppy will
gnaw on a cake of soap, but he does not do it
more than once, for he finds out it makes him ill.
And dogs have to learn to come when their
master calls them, and to lie down when they are
told, and to shake “hands,” and do other tricks—especially
in a circus.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Gurr showed Don, and his brothers
and sisters, how to sniff and smell along the
ground, so they would know their way back
again when they had gone away from home.
Dogs, you know, have very good noses for smell.
Even on a dark night, when a dog cannot see, he
can tell, just by sniffing the air, whether his
master is coming along, or whether it is some
one else.</p>

<p>So, when a dog takes a new road his paws
leave sort of a smell in the dust. This smell
stays there for some time, and when the dog
wants to get back, he just sniffs and smells along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the road until he finds where he has made his
tracks before, and in that way he gets home
again. He can do that even in the dark.</p>

<p>It was this lesson that Don’s mother taught
him, until he and the other puppies could run a
long way off from their kennel, even in the
woods, and could find their way back again.</p>

<p>“Now you will not get lost again, Don,” said
his mother to him.</p>

<p>“And I don’t want to,” Don said. “Being
lost is no fun.”</p>

<p>The puppy dog family lived in the kennel for
some time longer. The little doggies were all
growing larger and stronger, and could run
about now without falling down so often. Don
grew faster and larger than any of the others.</p>

<p>One day two boys came walking out to the
kennel where the puppies lived. One boy was
Willie, whose father owned Mrs. Gurr.</p>

<p>“Well, Willie, may I take my puppy now?”
asked the other boy.</p>

<p>“Yes, Bob, I guess he’s big enough now to
leave home,” said Willie. “Are you sure you
want the one you first picked out?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sure. I’ll take him,” said Bob.
“Don is the best puppy in the lot.”</p>

<br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_24">“He’s a fine dog!” cried Bob, as he patted and rubbed
Don.</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24-<br />25]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad he thinks I’m so nice,” said
Don to himself. He had begun to understand
boy and man talk, you see, though he could not
speak it himself.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll take Don,” went on Bob.</p>

<p>“I wonder where he’s going to take me?”
thought Don. “This is a funny world.”</p>

<p>Bob stooped over and picked Don up from
the pile of straw.</p>

<p><a href="#i_p023">“He’s a fine dog!” cried Bob, as he patted and
rubbed Don.</a> Don liked that. He was not
afraid of the boy, for the boy was kind.</p>

<p>Then, without giving Don a chance to say
good-by to his brothers and sisters, and without
even letting him kiss the mamma dog, Bob, the
boy, took Don away with him to a new home.</p>

<p>Don did not mind going away, for the boy was
so kind and good to him, and petted him so
nicely, that Don liked him at once. And Don
was not lonesome or homesick, for he saw many
new and strange things.</p>

<p>At last the boy went up the walk toward a
big white house, and he said to Don:</p>

<p>“Don, this is your new home.”</p>

<p>Though Don could not speak boy language, I
think he understood what the boy meant.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">“Mother, I have my dog!” cried Bob,
as he went into the big white house
with Don.</p>

<p>“Have you? That’s nice. I hope he’ll be a
good dog, and not come in on my clean carpets
with muddy feet,” said Bob’s mother. Don
heard her say this, and right away he made up
his little doggy mind that he would be as good
as a puppy dog can be. But he had many things
yet to learn.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m going to train him to be very good,”
said Bob to his mother. “He won’t give you a
bit of trouble, will you, Don?” and Bob held
Don high up in the air in his hands.</p>

<p>“Wow! Wow!” yelped Don.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s afraid! Put him down!” cried a
girl, with curly hair, who was playing with a
doll. She was Bob’s sister.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m going to teach him not to be afraid,”
said the boy, as he still held Don high in the
air. “You’re not afraid, are you, Don?”</p>

<p>“Wow!” said the puppy again, but this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
he was not so frightened. He knew Bob would
be kind to him, and not let him fall. And Bob
was very careful.</p>

<p>“Where are you going to keep your dog?”
asked Bob’s mother. “I can’t have him in the
house all the while.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m going to build a little kennel for
him, just like he had over at Willie’s house,
where he used to live,” said Bob. “I’m going
to make a hunting dog of him. Where’s my cap,
mother?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bob! You never can remember where
you leave your cap when you come in!” exclaimed
his mother. “Now that you have a dog
I think you had better train him to hunt your
cap, and other things for you. That would be a
good kind of hunting dog.”</p>

<p>“I guess it would,” laughed Bob. “Well,
come on, Don.”</p>

<p>Bob put Don down on the floor, but the puppy
dog, instead of running to his little master, when
he was called, ran over toward the girl who was
playing with a doll. I guess Don had never
seen a doll before.</p>

<p>“Here, sir! Come here when I call you!”
cried Bob, snapping his fingers.</p>

<p>But Don paid no attention.</p>

<p>“He likes me best!” said the girl, with a laugh.
“Come to me, Don.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, Sallie, you mustn’t do that, dear,” said
her mother. “If Bob is to have a dog it must
learn to mind him, and come when he calls. A
dog is not of much use unless it minds. First
let the dog learn to go to Bob, and then he will
teach it to come to you when you call.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I will,” promised Bob. “Now,
Don, you come to me!”</p>

<p>Don had not yet learned to mind. He still
wanted to go to the little girl named Sallie.
But Bob was not going to have that. So he
stooped over and picked up Don, giving him a
little shake, but, of course, not hurting him in the
least. For Bob would not do that.</p>

<p>“You must come to me when I call you, old
fellow!” said Bob. “I want my dog to be a
good dog, and mind me.”</p>

<p>So that was another lesson Don had to learn,
you see.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll try it again,” said the boy, after
he had patted Don, and stroked his silky ears.
“Now come when I call, Don. And, Sallie,
please don’t try to make him come to you.”</p>

<p>“I won’t, this time,” promised the little girl
with the doll.</p>

<p>Bob carried Don to one end of the room, and
put him down on the floor. Then Bob went
over and stood by the door.</p>

<p>“Come on, Don!” he called. “Come to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
sir!” Bob snapped his fingers. Don looked
up, lifted his ears so he might hear better, and
looked at Sallie.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t call you,” said the little girl.</p>

<p>“Here! Come to me!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>This time the puppy understood, and knew
what was wanted of him. With a little yelp he
ran toward his new master.</p>

<p>“That’s right! That’s the way to do!” cried
Bob. “Now he is learning to mind. He’ll be a
fine dog!”</p>

<p>Don was glad when he heard this, and he made
up his mind to be as good a dog as he could, even
if he was little.</p>

<p>Don was taken out and put in a box. Instead
of straw he had a piece of old carpet to lie on.</p>

<p>“That will do until I can get your regular
kennel made,” said Bob. “Then I’ll put some
straw in it for you to sleep on. But I guess you
must be thirsty. I’ll get you some milk.”</p>

<p>Don was very glad to get the nice saucer of
milk which the boy soon brought to him. He
licked it all up with his red tongue—I mean
Don, the puppy, licked up the milk, not Bob the
boy.</p>

<p>In a few days Bob had finished the kennel
for his new little pet, and Don had just as nice
a home as he had at first. Only it was quite
different. He had no brothers and sisters to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
play with, and at first he was a little lonesome.
He also missed the mamma dog, but so many
things happened to Don, and he saw so many
new and strange sights that, after a little while,
he forgot all about his first home.</p>

<p>Every day, and sometimes two and three times
a day, Bob would come out to see Don, and
would bring his pet some nice things to eat.
Then Bob would take him for a little walk.</p>

<p>Don’s new home was on a farm, and there were
many new animals for him to watch. Some of
them he did not know the names of, but he soon
got so he could tell a cow from a horse, even
though each of them had four legs and a tail.
But a cow had horns, and a horse did not.</p>

<p>Every day Don was learning something new.
He was growing to be a large puppy now, and
he could run fast, and not tumble down as he
had done at first. He had strong, sharp teeth,
too, though he did not want to bite any one.
He kept his teeth for gnawing on bones, and
chewing puppy cakes, which were hard—almost
as hard to eat as ginger snaps are for you.</p>

<p>Bob took Don with him to many places on the
farm, and also out into the woods. But Don
kept close to his new master, so as not to get lost.</p>

<p>“Though if I did get lost I think I could find
my way home again,” thought Don. “I could
easily sniff and smell my way back, I am sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>One day when Don was asleep in the nice,
soft straw of his new kennel which Bob had
made for him, the little puppy dog was suddenly
awakened by hearing a loud noise. It
sounded like:</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>Don jumped up and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“What am I going to do?” he asked. “Who
is it wants to know? Who are you? What’s
the matter?”</p>

<p>Then he heard the voice again, only, this time,
it seemed to say:</p>

<p>“Cock-a-doodle-doo!”</p>

<p>With that, a long neck, covered with feathers,
was thrust inside the kennel, and something
sharp pricked Don on his little black nose.</p>

<p>“Hi there!” he barked. “Please stop that.
You’re not a kitten or a cat, and you shouldn’t
scratch me that way!”</p>

<p>“Cock-a-doodle-do!” went the funny animal
again. “Of course I’m not a kitten or a cat.
I’m a rooster—the biggest rooster on the farm,
and I’m bigger even than you, no matter if you
are a puppy. You are so nice and soft that I
like to put my bill in your ribs!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I don’t like it!” barked Don, and he
tried to get out of the way, but the rooster kept
sticking his long neck inside the kennel, and
pecking at Don.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The little puppy dog hardly knew what to
do. If he ran out he was sure the rooster would
run after him. He had never seen a rooster before,
for all the chickens on the farm were kept
in their own yard, far away from the kennel.</p>

<p>Poor Don was not having a very good time.
He howled and barked, and tried to scare the
rooster, but the big fowl only kept on crowing,
and saying:</p>

<p>“Cock-a-doodle-do!”</p>

<p>It sounded just as if he said:</p>

<p>“What you going to do?”</p>

<p>Poor Don could not do anything.</p>

<p>But Sallie, Bob’s sister, saw what was going
on.</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried the little girl. “The big rooster
has gotten out of his coop, and he’s pecking Don.
Bob won’t like that. I must drive that rooster
away.”</p>

<p>So the little girl ran up to the kennel, crying:</p>

<p>“Shoo! Shoo! Go away you bad rooster!”</p>

<p>Then the rooster was frightened. He flapped
his wings, crowed again, and away he flew, off
to his coop behind the wire fence, where he belonged.</p>

<p>“You poor little puppy you!” cried Sallie, as
she tenderly picked Don up in her arms. “Did
the bad rooster bite you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wow! Eow! Yip! Yow!” said Don,
softly. But he was all right, now that the
rooster had been driven away.</p>

<p>Don was not much hurt, for a puppy dog is
so soft that a rooster’s bill does not do much
harm.</p>

<p>“But it was almost as bad as the time the cat
scratched me,” thought Don. “That’s two
things I’ve got to be afraid of—cats and roosters.
But when I get to be a big dog I won’t be afraid
of either one.”</p>

<p>When Bob came home from school his sister
told him about the rooster pecking the puppy
dog.</p>

<p>“There must be a hole in the fence, where the
rooster got out,” said Bob. “I’ll mend it.
Come on, Don, we’ll go fix the fence. Then the
rooster can’t get out again to bother you.”</p>

<p>“Bow-wow!” barked Don, for he was getting
old enough now to bark almost like a big dog.
I guess he meant to say that he was not afraid of
a rooster, though, to tell the truth, I think he <em>was</em>,
just a little bit.</p>

<p>“Come on, Don!” called Bob, and the dog
followed his master.</p>

<p>On the way to the chicken coop they passed the
pen where the pigs were kept.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll show you the pigs, Don,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Bob. “You must get to know them, so if any
of them get out, any time, you can chase them,
and make them go back into their pen.”</p>

<p>Bob lifted Don up in his arms, and held him
over the edge of the pig pen. There was one
big, mother pig, and seven little ones. One of
the little pigs had a funny, squinting eye. It
was partly closed, and the other eye was wide
open, and when this little pig looked up at you,
with one ear lifted up, and the other drooping
down, you felt as though you wanted to laugh,
he was so comical.</p>

<p>As Bob lifted his dog Don up to see the pigs,
this one I have told you about raised up on his
hind legs and squealed.</p>

<p>“Hello, Squinty!” called the boy, for the pig
was named Squinty, on account of his squinting
eye. “Hello, Squinty!” cried Bob. “I guess
you’d like to get out and dig in the garden, eh?
Well, you can’t, so you must stay in the pen.”</p>

<p>“Squee! Squee!” cried Squinty, the comical
pig, about whom I have told you in the book
named after him. He had many adventures,
did Squinty—adventures with Slicko, the
squirrel; with Mappo, the merry monkey; and
with Tum Tum, the jolly elephant.</p>

<p>“Squee! Squee!” grunted Squinty, looking at
Don in that funny way.</p>

<p>“No, you can’t get out,” said Bob, laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Squinty looked at Don.</p>

<p>“You look like a nice dog,” said the little pig.
“Can’t you come and let me out of the pen, some
day when no one is looking? Do come! I’m
tired of staying in here. Wuff! Wuff!”</p>

<p>“Bow-wow!” barked Don, and that was how
he got to know Squinty, the comical pig.</p>

<p>“Will you come and bite a hole in the pen so
I can get out?” asked Squinty of Don.</p>

<p>“Bow wow! No, that would not be right,”
Don said, for he and the little pig could talk
together in animal talk, which Bob, the boy,
could not understand. Bob thought his dog and
the pig were just grunting and squealing, and
barking and whining. That goes to show you
animals can do things we cannot do.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t let you out,” said Don, as his
master set him down, and walked over toward
the chicken coop, where the boy was going to
fix the fence so the big rooster could not get out
again.</p>

<p>But, just before they got there, something happened.
There was a loud noise, and Bob’s sister
Sallie screamed:</p>

<p>“Oh, Bob! The big black bull is loose! The
big black bull has jumped over the pasture
fence! Oh, Bob!”</p>

<p>“Come on, Don!” cried Bob. “There’s some
work for us!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>DON SEES TUM TUM</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Don hardly knew what to think when
Bob, his boyish master, called to him
that way. The little dog had not
lived long enough in the world to know much
about bulls jumping fences. But he could easily
tell that Bob’s sister, Sallie, was very much
frightened. A dog can tell very quickly when a
person is frightened, or glad, or cross.</p>

<p>“Come on, Don!” cried Bob, as he ran as fast
as he could.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Sallie. “Oh,
Bob! Don’t you know the bad black bull is
loose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course I know it,” answered Bob.
“And that’s where I’m going.”</p>

<p>“What! Not to the bull, are you?” asked
Sallie.</p>

<p>“That’s just where I’m going,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“But he’ll hook you with his horns, and maybe—maybe
he’ll step on you!” exclaimed Sallie.
“Listen to him call!”</p>

<p>From a field, not far away, came a noise that
sounded like:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“Boo! Boo! Boo!”</p>

<p>“Bow wow!” barked Don.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the bull all right,” said Bob.
“But we’ll drive him back in the lot where he
belongs, won’t we, Don, old fellow?”</p>

<p>“Bow wow!” barked Don again. I suppose
he was saying: “Yes, yes! Of course we will!”</p>

<p>Don knew nothing about bad black bulls, and
Bob was not a very big boy. Still he was brave,
and so was Don.</p>

<p>“Come on, old fellow!” called Bob to the dog.</p>

<p>“Bow wow!” barked Don. “I’m coming!”</p>

<p>“Oh dear!” cried Sallie. She couldn’t help
being just a little bit afraid. Girls are made that
way on purpose, so boys and dogs can protect
them.</p>

<p>“Boo! Boo!” bellowed the bull again, and
Bob, running on ahead, with Don coming after
him, soon came to the field where the big animal,
with his sharp horns, was pawing up the dirt.</p>

<p>“Get back where you belong!” called Bob to
the bull. “Get back, I say!”</p>

<p>“Bow wow!” barked Don, the brave dog. At
first Don felt a little afraid when he saw the big
black animal.</p>

<p>But when Don saw how close his brave master
Bob went to the bull, and shook a stick at
him, Don said to himself:</p>

<p>“Well, if Bob is brave, I must be brave too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
It would never do to run away and leave him to
drive the bull all by himself. I must stay with
him.”</p>

<p>That is the way dogs nearly always do. They
are very brave, and faithful to their masters,
staying by them when they are in danger or when
they are hurt. So Don did not run away.</p>

<p>Instead he ran close to the heels of the bull,
and barked as loudly as he could. It is a good
thing Don did that, for the bull, with a shake of
his head, had just made up his mind to run at
Bob and maybe stick the boy with the sharp
horns, for all I know. Mind, I am not saying
for sure, but maybe.</p>

<p>When Don barked so close to the bull’s legs,
the big black animal thought he was going to be
bitten. So <a href="#i_p039">he turned quickly, to shake his head
and horns at Don</a>, and in that way Bob was not
hurt.</p>

<p>Bob was not the least bit afraid. He kept on
shaking his stick at the bull, and throwing stones
and pieces of dirt at him, sometimes hitting him
on the nose. The bull did not like this.</p>

<p>And the big animal did not like Don barking
at his heels, either. It made the big, black animal
think he was going to be bitten.</p>

<p>“Keep at it, Don!” cried Bob. “We’ll soon
have this bull back where he belongs! Drive
him out of this field!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_38">He turned quickly to shake his head and horns at Don.</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40-<br />41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bow wow!” barked Don, which meant, in
dog language: “Of course we’ll drive him back.
I’m not afraid.”</p>

<p>So, with the barking of the dog, and the way
Bob shook his stick and threw stones, the bull
began to feel that perhaps he had better be good,
and go back where he belonged.</p>

<p>The bull was still rather angry, and he kept
shaking his head and his horns, and pawing up
the ground with his front feet. Still he backed
slowly out of the lot where he did not belong,
and pretty soon along came Bob’s father, with
a big stick. Sallie, Bob’s sister, had gone to
call her father when she saw Bob and Don trying
to keep the bull from getting into the road.</p>

<p>“Get back there!” cried Bob’s father, and
slowly the bull went back, until he was safely
locked in the pasture from which he had gotten
out by jumping the fence.</p>

<p>“Well, Bob,” said his father, “you are a brave
little chap. Did you drive back the black bull
all alone?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” answered Bob. “Don helped me,
didn’t you, Don?”</p>

<p>“Bow wow!” barked Don, as Bob put his
arms around the shaggy neck of his pet.</p>

<p>“Well, he certainly is a fine dog!” said the
man, as he patted Don on the head. And you
can just imagine how proud Don was. For he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was only a puppy yet, and I think even a larger
dog might have been a little afraid to bark at
the big, black bull. But Don started in by being
brave, and that is a good way to begin life.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dog is a good one,” said Bob.
“We’re not afraid of bulls, are we, Don?”</p>

<p>“Bow wow!” barked Don. “No indeed!”</p>

<p>“Well, I must make the fence higher so the
bull can’t get out again,” said the farmer.</p>

<p>Then he and Bob and Don went up to the
farmhouse, Don wagging his tail on the way,
for that is what dogs do when they are pleased
and happy.</p>

<p>Don was growing every day. He had good
things to eat, he could run about and play as he
pleased, and he had a nice warm place to sleep.
All those things make puppies grow into big
dogs. Of course some dogs are little, and always
stay that way, but Don was one of the kind
that grows to be large.</p>

<p>Bob, his master, was very fond of Don, and
took him with him everywhere he went—except
to school, of course. A dog could not go to
school any more than could Mary’s little lamb.
But often, when it was nearly time for school to
be out, Don would slip off down the road, toward
the little red schoolhouse.</p>

<p>Not far from it he would lie down in the
shade of a tree to wait until the boys and girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
came out. Then Don would rush up, barking
as loudly as he could, and wagging his tail, for
he wanted to see Bob. Don was lonesome without
him.</p>

<p>And what fun Bob and his boy chums had
with Don on the way home from school! Don
would carry Bob’s books, and if any other boy,
even in fun, tried to take the books away from
Don, the dog would growl and bark a little, as
though saying:</p>

<p>“Now that’s all very well, in fun. But you
must not take these books. If you do, I might
have to bite you, just a least little bit, and I
wouldn’t like to do that. So please don’t touch
Bob’s books.”</p>

<p>And none of the boys dared.</p>

<p>Bob taught Don how to lie down and roll over
when he was told, and how to sit up on his hind
legs and not move even when a sweet cracker,
or something else good to eat, was put on the
dog’s nose. Don would sit there, just as steady
as a clock, until Bob called out:</p>

<p>“Now you may eat it, Don!”</p>

<p>Then Don would flip his nose, toss the cracker
up into the air, and as it came down he would
grab it in his white teeth and chew it up. Oh,
how good it tasted!</p>

<p>Bob also taught Don how to play soldier, and
march around with a paper cap on his head, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a broom for a gun. And Don could jump over
chairs, and do many other things, that only circus
dogs are supposed to do. Bob was very
fond of his pet Don.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when Bob was off to school, Don
would walk around the farm, looking at the
cows, horses and chickens. He was not afraid
of the big red rooster now, though once he had
been, when he was a little puppy. Instead the
rooster was afraid of Don, though the dog would
not harm even a baby chicken. All Don did
was to drive the chickens out of the garden when
he was told.</p>

<p>“How de doo—de doo!” the rooster would
crow, when he saw Don outside the chicken
yard. “How de doo—de doo?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m pretty well, thank you,” Don would
answer. “How are you? Bow wow!”</p>

<p>Then they would talk together in rooster and
dog language—that is, after the rooster got over
being afraid of Don.</p>

<p>Sometimes Don would go to see if the big,
black bull was safely shut up in his pasture lot.
Don and the bull never got to be good friends.
I guess the bull was rather angry at Don for
having driven him back that time he got loose.
On some days Don would go to the pen where
Squinty, the comical pig, lived with his mother
and brothers and sisters. Don could look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
through a crack in the boards and see the pigs.</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, I say, help me get a board off
the pen and run out,” Squinty would beg of Don.</p>

<p>“No indeed! I’m not going to let you out,”
Don would answer.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll get out all by myself,” Squinty
would say.</p>

<p>And one day he did. With his strong, rubbery
nose Squinty pushed and pushed on a loose
board of his pen, until the board came off, and
Squinty was out in the garden. He had a good
time, as I have told you in the book about the
comical little pig, so I will not put his adventures
in here. For this book is to be about Don, or,
at least, mostly about him.</p>

<p>Then the farmer found out that Squinty was
loose.</p>

<p>“Here Don! Don!” called Bob’s father, for
Bob was off to school. “There’s a pig loose,
Don! Drive him back to his pen!”</p>

<p>“Bow wow! I will!” cried Don, and he ran
up to take Squinty by the ear and lead him back.
Don did not bite Squinty, though the comical
little pig squealed as though he were badly hurt.
But Don took him safely back to the pen.</p>

<p>Then, one day, Squinty got out again, and this
time he wandered off a long distance before Don
was sent after him. When the dog did find the
little pig, Don saw a strange sight. Along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
country road were rumbling big red, green and
golden colored wagons, drawn by many horses.</p>

<p>But, strangest of all, Don saw in the woods a
little hairy animal, with a long tail, and four
hands—or so it seemed to Don. And then there
was another queer animal, with two tails, one in
front, and one behind.</p>

<p>“Bow wow!” barked Don when he saw this
animal. “I had better run away from here. I
don’t like this! Two tails! Oh my!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be afraid,” said Squinty. “That’s
only Tum Tum.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>DON RUNS AWAY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Don, who had been barking and growling
to make Squinty, the comical pig, go
back to his pen, stopped suddenly, and
grew very quiet when he saw the funny, hairy,
four-handed animal, and also the one that seemed
to have two tails. Don crouched down in the
bushes to hide away, for, though he had not been
afraid of the big, black bull, this queer beast
was much larger, and so different.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” said Squinty, again.
“That is only Tum Tum.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean—Tum Tum?” asked
Don. “That sounds like the name of a drum.
And why shouldn’t I be afraid of an animal with
two tails? especially when he is so big,” asked
Don.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t two tails,” grunted Squinty, the
comical pig. “I thought the same thing at first,
until Mappo told me different.”</p>

<p>“Who is Mappo?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“Mappo is this chap—a merry monkey,” answered
the little pig, as he pointed with one paw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
toward the queer, furry, four-handed and long-tailed
animal.</p>

<p>“Oh, so your name is Mappo, is it?” asked
Don, for he found that he could talk to the other
animals, as well as understand them.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am Mappo,” the monkey said. “But
please don’t speak my name so loudly.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” Don wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Because I have run away from a circus,” answered
Mappo. And then Don saw that what
he had thought were hands were only paws, but
they were almost like hands, and the monkey’s
tail was almost like a fifth hand to him.</p>

<p>“Run away from a circus?” barked Don.
“What’s a circus?”</p>

<p>“That’s it, out there,” Squinty said, as he
nodded his head toward the big red, green and
golden wagons that were rumbling along the
country road. “Mappo and Tum Tum belong
to the circus, but Mappo has run away, just as
I ran from the pen. Tum Tum is after him.”</p>

<p>“Who is Tum Tum?” asked Don again.</p>

<p>“He’s that big elephant,” answered Mappo,
as he pointed toward the creature.</p>

<p>“Oh ho!” barked Don, and he was not so
frightened now. “So that is what you call an
animal with two tails; an elephant?”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t two tails, I tell you,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Squinty, with a pig-laugh. “One is his tail—that’s
the short one, and the other is his trunk.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look like a trunk,” said Don. “I
know what a trunk is. There are some in the
attic of the house where I live, and Bob’s mother
keeps her clothes in them. I don’t see how Tum
Tum could keep any clothes in that trunk that
hangs down from his mouth.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that kind of a trunk,” said the big
elephant with a deep, jolly laugh. “My trunk
is just a long nose, to breathe through, and squirt
water through, and I can curl it around and
pick up things with it.”</p>

<p>And to prove how easy it was he just picked
up Mappo, the merry monkey, in his trunk,
Tum Tum did, and set him on his back.</p>

<p>“Oh ho! So that’s what a trunk is for!” exclaimed
Don. “Well, I am glad to know, and
I am glad I met you, Mappo and Tum Tum.
But now, Squinty, you must come back to your
pen with me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to go!” squealed the little pig.</p>

<p>“But you must come!” Don said. “I was sent
after you and I am going to take you home, even
if I have to lead you all the way by the ear.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you had better go,” said Tum Tum.
“I have been sent from the circus to bring back
Mappo, the merry monkey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I am not coming,” Mappo said. “I
have run away, and I am not going to run back
again until after I have some fun.”</p>

<p>And if you want to read all the things the
monkey and the elephant did, you may do so in
the special books about them, just as you may
read about Squinty, the comical pig.</p>

<p>One book is called, “Mappo, the Merry
Monkey,” and the other “Tum Tum, the Jolly
Elephant.” I have not room in this book to set
down all their wonderful adventures.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you coming back with me?” asked
Tum Tum of Mappo.</p>

<p>“No, I am going to run away some more,”
Mappo chattered, in monkey fashion, and off
through the bushes he slipped, to have some fun.</p>

<p>“I am sorry about that,” said Tum Tum, the
jolly elephant, as he crashed through the underbrush.
“I shall have to go back to the circus
without Mappo.”</p>

<p>“But I am not going back to the farm without
you, Squinty,” said Don, the dog, and with that
he took hold of the comical little pig, and led
him through the woods to his pen.</p>

<p>“The monkey and the elephant can do as they
like,” said Don, “but my master told me to fetch
back any runaway pigs I saw, and I am going
to do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t like you,” said Squinty, rather crossly
to Don, as they went along through the woods.</p>

<p>“Well, I am sorry about that,” barked Don,
“for I do not mean to be unkind to you. Still I
must take you back where you belong.”</p>

<p>“And just when I was having such fun, running
away!” went on Squinty, disappointed.</p>

<p>“It isn’t any fun to run away,” spoke Don, as
he took hold of Squinty’s ear in a new place, so
as not to hurt the comical little pig with the
queer, squinty eye.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t it?” squealed Squinty. “That’s because
you never tried it—you don’t know. Now
if you were to run away once, you’d have so
much fun you’d like it, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Did you have any fun when you ran away?”
asked Don.</p>

<p>“Lots of fun,” answered Squinty. “That is, I
did have until you came along and spoiled it all.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry I spoiled it, but I had to
bring you home,” spoke Don. “You belong at
the farm you know—not in a circus with
monkeys and elephants.”</p>

<p>“But it’s lots of fun in a circus,” went on
Squinty. “I say, Don,” he went on eagerly,
“let’s run away together and join the circus.
We could learn to do tricks, and have lots of fun.
Come on!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“No indeed!” growled Don. “I’m not going
to run away.”</p>

<p>“But think of the fun you’d have,” Squinty
went on. “At the farm nothing ever happens.”</p>

<p>“There doesn’t, eh?” asked Don. “I suppose
you call the bad, black bull breaking out of his
pasture, and Bob and me driving him back—I
suppose you call that nothing!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that, of course,” admitted Squinty.</p>

<p>“And then running after you—is that nothing?”
Don wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Well, I wish <em>that</em> hadn’t happened,” Squinty
said. “But I mean lots more happens if you
run away than if you stay at home. Just think!
Everything is the same every day when you’re
on the farm. You get your meals just so often,
and you always have to come when Bob calls
you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I like that, for I love my little master
Bob,” said Don. “And I like my three meals a
day.”</p>

<p>“But if you ran away you could eat as often
as you pleased,” said Squinty.</p>

<p>“Do you really think so?” asked Don, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it,” Squinty said.</p>

<p>“Well,” spoke Don, “I never thought of that.
Maybe there is something in this running away
after all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>And, for the first time since he had come to
live with Bob on the farm, Don began to think
of running away. He had never thought of
such a thing before, and he wouldn’t have done
so then, only Squinty put it into his head, you
see.</p>

<p>Don kept hold of Squinty’s ear all the way
back to the farm and led the comical little pig
right up to the pen from which he had broken
out.</p>

<p>“There you are!” growled Don, but his voice
was quite friendly.</p>

<p>“Yes, here I am, back again,” sighed Squinty,
sorrowfully. “I wish you had let me run
farther away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I couldn’t think of it,” barked Don.</p>

<p>“Never mind. Maybe some day you’ll run
away yourself,” went on Squinty, “and then
you’ll be sorry if some one makes you come back
home.”</p>

<p>“No, I never will,” Don said.</p>

<p>The farmer, who owned the pigs, came running
out of the barn.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare!” he cried. “If Don hasn’t
brought back that rascal Squinty, who ran away!
Good dog, Don!”</p>

<p>Then Don felt very proud and happy, and
wagged his tail so hard that it is a wonder it did
not fall off. But then a dog’s tail is made quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
tightly fast to him, you see, so it cannot wag
off.</p>

<p>“No,” said Don, as he went to his kennel to
dig up a nice, juicy bone he had buried near it,
“no, I’ll never run away—never!”</p>

<p>But you just wait and see what Don did.</p>

<p>For several days after he had brought back
Squinty, the comical pig, nothing much happened
to Don. He played about with Bob, his
little master, chased the chickens out of the
garden, and did some of his tricks. One day
Tabby, the cat, came out to talk to him.</p>

<p>Don and Tabby were good friends. The dog
had always been kind to cats, since his mother
had told him to be, and Tabby was not afraid of
Don, though she would fluff up her tail, and
round up her back, when she saw some dogs that
were not friends of hers.</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever get tired of staying here all
the while, Don?” asked Tabby, as she sat in the
sunshine, washing her face with her velvety paw.
Dogs and cats can talk to each other you know,
though we cannot understand them.</p>

<p>“Why, no, I don’t know as I get tired,” Don
answered. “What makes you ask that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” meowed Tabby. “Sometimes
I feel as if I should like to run away, and
see how the world looks away from this farm.
I have been here all my life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“So have I—nearly,” Don went on. “But I
like it here.”</p>

<p>Still, what Tabby had said to him, and what
Squinty, the comical pig, had said to him, stayed
in Don’s mind. As the days passed, and the
warm, beautiful summer weather came, Don
said:</p>

<p>“I wonder how it would seem to run away?
I’ve a good notion to try it, just once. Then I
could come back, and tell Tabby and Squinty
and the other farm animals that there is really
no fun in running away. That would make
them contented, and they would be glad to stay
here.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I’ll run away, but only just to
tell the others how it seems, so they won’t want
to do it. In that way I would be doing Bob and
his father a favor. Yes, I shall run away.”</p>

<p>So Don ran away, and then began some wonderful
adventures for him.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>DON IS LOCKED IN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">When Don made up his mind to run
away from the farm, he chose a time
to do it when Bob would be away at
school. For the dog well knew that if Bob were
at home there would be little chance of getting
away without being seen.</p>

<p>Bob always wanted Don with him, and, as
soon as the boy came home from his lessons, the
first thing he would do would be to run out to
the kennel to see how Don was.</p>

<p>“Yes,” thought Don to himself, in a way dogs
have of thinking, that we know nothing about,
“yes, if I am to run away I must go when Bob
is not at home. Otherwise he might stop me.</p>

<p>“But I won’t run away very far,” thought
Don, “and I’ll soon run back again, to tell these
silly farm animals that they are much better off
stopping safely at home.”</p>

<p>That is what Don thought, but things do not
always happen the way we think, or even the
way dogs think.</p>

<p>Don walked out of his kennel, after he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
had a good dinner, looked carefully about to
see that no one saw him, and off down the road
he trotted.</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought to say good-by to Bob,”
thought Don, “but then he doesn’t always understand
my way of talking. Besides, if I said
good-by to him he’d know I was going away, and
he’d stop me. So I guess I won’t wait.”</p>

<p>Don trotted off, past the farmhouse, down the
country road. Tabby, the big yellow cat, was
sunning herself on the porch as Don went past.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Tabby, stretching
out her paws.</p>

<p>“Oh, just to take a walk,” answered Don.
For he did not want Tabby to follow him, and,
after all, he was <em>walking</em> away, rather than running
away—at least, at first.</p>

<p>“I don’t want any cats chasing after me,”
thought Don. “No one takes any one with him
when he runs away—at least Squinty didn’t, and
he ought to know all about running away, for
he’s done it twice. No, I’ll go alone.”</p>

<p>Off Don went.</p>

<p>At first it was very pleasant, trotting along the
road, in the shade. Now and then Don would
stop to get a drink at a wayside spring. Or he
might see a flock of birds, and he would chase
after them, with his red tongue hanging out of
his mouth. Don did not want to catch the birds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
but he just wanted something to run after, and
birds were as good as anything else.</p>

<p>After a while Don met another dog, named
Rover, who lived on the next farm.</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Rover, speaking in dog
language of course, and wagging his tail.
“Glad to see you, Don. Where you going?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no place, special,” answered Don. He
was wondering whether he might not tell Rover
about running away, and ask the other dog to
come with him.</p>

<p>“A dog to run away with would be all right,”
thought Don, “but not a cat. I guess I’ll ask
Rover.”</p>

<p>So Don said:</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, Rover, I don’t know
just where I am going. I am running away, to
see the world, and have some adventures, and
perhaps you’d like to come with me.”</p>

<p>“What! Running away?” cried Rover.
“Not for me! I’m going to stay home!”</p>

<p>“But think of the adventures we’ll have,” said
Don. “Come on!”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” answered Rover. “Once I
ran away, and I was glad enough to run back
again. You will be, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think so,” said Don. “Besides,
so many of the animals on our farm are talking
of running away, that I thought if I went, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
came back to tell them all about it, they wouldn’t
want to run any more.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps they won’t,” said Rover.
“But I’m sure you’ll be glad to get back.”</p>

<p>“No, I will not!” cried Don, and then he ran
quickly and hid behind a lilac bush.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Rover, in a barking
whisper.</p>

<p>“Hush!” growled Don. “It’s your master. I
don’t want him to see me here, for when Bob
finds I am gone he will hunt for me, and your
master may tell him I was here.”</p>

<p>“All right. Hide,” said Rover. “I won’t
tell where you are. But, mind what I’m telling
you. Very glad indeed you’ll be to get back
home again!”</p>

<p>Don did not think so, and, after Rover’s master
had passed on, the runaway dog came out of his
hiding place in the bushes, and, saying good-by
to the other dog, off Don went again, down the
road.</p>

<p>“Well, I am certainly having a good time,”
thought Don. “Squinty was right about it;
there’s lots of fun in running away. No wonder
he didn’t want to run back again.”</p>

<p>On and on trotted Don, stopping now and then
to speak to other dogs he knew, and sometimes
resting in the shade near a spring of water.
Then off he would go again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” thought Don, after a bit, “I am beginning
to feel hungry. Let me see. What do
you do when you get hungry if you are running
away? I meant to ask Squinty about that, but
I forgot it. I guess I can find something to
eat.”</p>

<p>This was not as easy as Don had thought it
would be. It was quite different from having
Bob, or Bob’s mother or sister, bring out a nice
plate of table scraps or a juicy bone. No one
brought Don anything now, for he was a runaway
dog.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Don to himself, in a way
dogs have, “I guess I can go up to the back door
of one of these houses, and pick up a bone or
two. I’ll try it.”</p>

<p>Just then he was passing a large white house,
that looked something like the one where his
kennel was.</p>

<p>“There’s sure to be plenty to eat in a place like
that,” thought Don.</p>

<p>Around to the back door he trotted, and,
surely enough, he saw on the ground some bones
with bits of meat on them. Don felt more
hungry than ever when he saw them.</p>

<p>“Ah ha!” he whispered to himself, as he licked
his teeth with his red tongue, “now for a fine dinner!
Why this is as good as I would get at
home. Who says running away isn’t jolly?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>But, just as Don was going to pick up the
nicest bone, a harsh voice called to him:</p>

<p>“Here! Get out of there! Be off!” and a
stone was thrown at Don, hitting him on the leg.</p>

<p>“Ouch!” he yelped. “Ouch! Bow wow!”</p>

<p>“Get away from there! Get out of this yard!”
the harsh voice went on, and when a window was
raised, Don saw a big, fat cook-woman, with a
pan of water in her hand. She was just going to
throw it on Don, but he ran out of the way in
time.</p>

<p>“My! How impolite!” thought Don. “I
never heard of such treatment! Just as if it
would hurt anything if I took those bones nobody
wants! The idea!”</p>

<p>Don felt quite badly as he ran away. No one
had ever treated him that way before—not even
when he was a little puppy, and he was now a
big dog.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll try another house,” thought Don,
as he trotted on. “Maybe they will be kinder
there. Anyhow I’m glad I ran before that
fat woman had time to throw water on me. I
wonder if it was hot water?”</p>

<p>Don trotted along, getting hungrier and
hungrier every minute, until he saw another
house. This one was painted red, but it was
quite as large as the white one.</p>

<p>“Now to see if I can find a bone in this back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
yard,” Don thought, as he ran in. He saw a
tin can in one corner of the yard, and from the
can came a nice smell of bones.</p>

<p>“Ah ha!” thought Don. “Something to eat
there, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>He went up to the can, and was just lifting the
cover off with his paw, to get at the bone inside,
when another harsh voice called to him:</p>

<p>“Be off out of there! I believe you’re the dog
who rolled in my pansy-flower bed the other day.
Get away from here! I don’t like dogs!”</p>

<p>Don looked up in time to see the gardener
flinging a stone at him, and Don dodged out of
the way, so as not to be hit.</p>

<p>“Be off!” cried the man.</p>

<p>Poor Don tucked his tail between his legs and
ran out of the yard. A stone once more came
bounding after him, and almost hit him.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” thought the runaway dog.
“This is certainly a hard life! I’ve been cheated
out of my dinner twice. And no one wanted
those bones, either. I don’t see why I couldn’t
have had them!”</p>

<p>Don was beginning to find out that it was not
so much fun running away as he had thought it
would be. And he was getting so hungry!</p>

<p>On and on he ran, for some distance. Pretty
soon he saw another large, fine house.</p>

<p>“Rich people must live in there,” he thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
“but twice, now, I have been driven away from
big houses. I think I’ll try a smaller one.”</p>

<p>So he went on and on until he came to a little
house, where a poor old lady lived.</p>

<p>Don sniffed and smelled about, looking for a
bone. But he could find none in this yard.
However, the lady, looking out of her kitchen
window, saw the dog, and she knew he must be
hungry. Then Don saw a bit of bread lying on
the ground. The lady had fed the birds that
morning, and part of the bread was left.</p>

<p>“I’ll get that, anyhow!” thought Don, and he
swallowed it very quickly.</p>

<p>“Poor dog! I believe you’re hungry!” said
the lady, kindly.</p>

<p>“Ha! I <em>know</em> I’m hungry,” said Don to himself,
for of course he could not speak to the
lady in her language.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a bone,” she said, and she threw
something out of the window at Don. At first
the runaway dog thought it was another stone,
but as soon as he smelled the bone he knew
better.</p>

<p>“But I’m not going to run any chances,” Don
thought. So, with a bark of thanks to the kind
lady, Don caught the bone in his teeth, and out
he ran with it into the street. And no sooner
had he gotten there, than another dog, bigger
than Don, saw him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried the other dog. “Give me
that bone! It’s mine!”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” spoke Don, politely, for
he had been brought up that way, “but this is my
bone—a lady gave it to me.”</p>

<p>“No it isn’t! It’s mine!” growled the other
dog, and he began to run after Don. But Don
was not going to lose the bone the kind lady had
given him, so away he ran as fast as he could
go, with the other dog following after, like Jack
and Jill falling down hill, you know.</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop! Give me that bone!” cried the
bad dog.</p>

<p>“No! No!” answered Don.</p>

<p>Though the other dog was larger and stronger
than Don, he could not run as fast, and Don was
soon out of sight around the corner, trotting as
fast as he could go, with the bone in his mouth.</p>

<p>“Well, so far so good,” thought Don. “I
never imagined before that it was so hard and
dangerous to get anything to eat. It isn’t this
way on the farm. Still I am running away—that
is something, and I suppose these are only
adventures.”</p>

<p>Soon Don came to a quiet, shady place, near
where a street-fountain of water bubbled up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<div id="i_p065" class="figcenter" style="width: 358px;">

<br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_66">Other dogs, coming to the fountain to get a drink, wanted

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66-<br />67]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll lie down here and eat my bone,” thought
Don. But it was not as easy to do as he thought.
As soon as he began to gnaw the meat off the
bone, <a href="#i_p065">other dogs, coming to the fountain to get
a drink, wanted to take Don’s bone away from
him</a>. At last Don said:</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll have no peace or quietness here.
I’ll find another place.” Picking up his bone,
he ran on until he came to a railroad station.
Don knew what this was, for the railroad ran
not far from the farm, and Don had often gone
to the depot with Bob to see the trains go by.</p>

<p>Don saw a big brown freight car, with the
door open, standing on the track.</p>

<p>“I’ll get in there and eat my bone,” thought
Don, and with one jump, up into the car he
leaped. There no other dogs bothered him as
he gnawed the juicy bone, and then, after this
little lunch, Don fell asleep.</p>

<p>How long he slept he did not know, but when
he awoke he found himself in the dark, and the
car was rumbling along over the track.</p>

<p>“Oh, the train must have started!” thought
Don. “I must get out.” But, when he tried,
he found the door of the freight car was tightly
shut. Poor Don was locked in.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>DON IN THE CITY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Poor Don did not know what to do.
There he was, shut tightly up in a dark
freight car, that was rumbling over the
rails as fast as it could go.</p>

<p>“Well,” thought Don, in a way dogs have of
thinking, “I am in a fix now. I had much
better have stopped at home. Running away
isn’t as much fun as I thought it was.”</p>

<p>He looked about the car, but he could see no
way to get out. There were some boxes and
barrels in one corner, but as Don went up to sniff
and smell of them he could tell they had in them
nothing good to eat.</p>

<p>My! What a rumbling the train made as it
puffed along.</p>

<p>“I wonder where I am being taken to?”
thought Don. “I guess I am in for an adventure.
Well, I’ll make the best of it.”</p>

<p>Once more Don went over to the door, and
tried to push it open with his nose. But it was
not a swinging door like the one in the house at
home. Instead, it slid back and forth. What
had happened was this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>When Don was asleep, after having eaten the
bone the good lady gave him, a train-man had
come along, and closed the door of the freight
car. He did not see Don sleeping inside there
to keep out of the way of other dogs, or, if he
had, the brakeman might have called to Don to
get out, before the door was locked. But, as it
was, Don was locked in. And now he was being
taken away—where, he could not tell.</p>

<p>Don was beginning to feel hungry again, and,
worse than this, he was thirsty. He could stand
being hungry, for he had had a bone, only a little
while before. But oh! how thirsty he was.
And there was not a drop of water in the car.</p>

<p>Poor Don put out his tongue, and licked his
dry lips. There is not anything quite so bad for
an animal as to be thirsty, and if ever you have a
dog or cat, I hope you will see to it that they
can always get clean, fresh water to drink, especially
in hot weather.</p>

<p>Poor Don’s tongue hung out of his mouth,
and his breath came fast.</p>

<p>Up and down the freight car ran Don, looking
for water in every corner, but there was
none. Then he thought to himself:</p>

<p>“I’ll bark and howl. That will let the men
know I want a drink, and they’ll bring me some
water. That’s what I’ll do. I’ll bark and
howl. I ought to have thought of that before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>So Don sat down in the middle of the car, on
his hind legs, and, lifting up his head, he howled.
Then he barked, doing both as loudly as he
could.</p>

<p>But the train made such a rumbling noise, and
the engine whistled so loudly, that Don’s howls
and barks could not be heard.</p>

<p>But he kept on howling and barking, until his
poor throat and tongue were tired, and he was
thirstier than ever.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll have to stop,” thought Don.
“This isn’t doing any good, and it only makes me
feel worse than ever. Oh, if I could only get
out!”</p>

<p>Then poor Don, tired out and weary, lay down
and tried to sleep.</p>

<p>But it was hard work even to sleep in the
rumbling car, though at last Don dozed off for
a little while. Then he suddenly awakened,
and as he sat up he knew what had made him
stop sleeping. It was the sudden quiet that had
come after all the noise.</p>

<p>The train had come to a stop. It no longer
rumbled over the rails, and the car did not sway
from side to side.</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe I can get out now!” thought Don,
jumping up. Once more he barked and howled,
but he could not do it so loudly now, or he was so
thirsty his throat seemed all swelled shut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, after giving a pitiful howl, Don
heard the voices of men outside the freight car.
And Don knew enough of men’s talk to hear one
of them ask:</p>

<p>“Don’t you hear a dog somewhere?”</p>

<p>“Seems to me I do,” answered another voice.
“I wonder where it can be?”</p>

<p>“I’ll soon show them where it is,” thought
Don. “I’ll howl again for them.”</p>

<p>Once more he howled and barked.</p>

<p>“Why the dog is in this freight car!” exclaimed
the first man.</p>

<p>“So he is!” cried the second. “We’ll let him
out. We don’t want to be carrying a dog with
us.”</p>

<p>In a little while the door of the freight car
slid open, and as soon as Don saw the first streak
of daylight come in, he gave a yelp of delight.</p>

<p>“Now I can get out and get a drink!” he
thought.</p>

<p>So, without stopping to say anything to the
men for letting him out, except to give a short
bark, which meant “Thank you!” Don jumped
to the ground and ran as fast as he could. He
did not care which way he went, as long as he
could find some water.</p>

<p>“Look at that dog run!” cried one of the men.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess he is badly scared,” said the
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Don was not so much frightened as he was
thirsty; he was a brave dog. As he ran along,
trying to smell his way to the nearest water, he
thought:</p>

<p>“Oh, if ever I get safely back to my kennel
once more, I’ll never run away again. That
other dog, Rover, was right—it’s no fun to run
away.”</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, Don smelled water.
He looked in the direction from which the smell
came, and he saw a big stream of water splashing
down into the engine that had drawn the
train of freight cars. For the engine has to have
water, just as a dog does, only the engine makes
steam of it. And it was the engine taking water
at a big tank that Don saw.</p>

<p>Some of the water splashed down from the
engine tank and made a little puddle beside the
track. Don trotted up to this puddle and took a
long drink. And oh! how good it tasted.</p>

<p>“Humph! That dog was thirsty all right,”
said the engineer as he leaned out of his cab
window and watched his engine getting a drink
too. “I wonder where that dog came from?”</p>

<p>“I came from a freight car—that’s where I
came from,” said Don, but of course he spoke
only to himself, sort of thinking like, and the
engineer did not hear anything.</p>

<p>Don took another drink of the cool water, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
he did not mind if it was a bit muddy. At home,
in his kennel, Bob the boy, would never think
of giving his pet dog anything but clean water
to drink.</p>

<p>“But it’s different, when you run away,”
thought Don. “Then you have to take what you
can get.”</p>

<p>He felt much better, now that he had
quenched his thirst. But he was beginning to
feel hungry.</p>

<p>“The bone I left in the car is no good, for
there is no more meat on it,” thought Don. “I
shall have to look for a new one.”</p>

<p>Then, for the first time since he had come out
of the freight car, Don looked about him, to
see where he was. He saw many trains, and
railroad tracks, and, off in the distance a number
of houses and church spires as well as factory
chimneys.</p>

<p>“I must be in some city,” thought Don. And
he was right. The freight train had stopped
outside a large city, where Don was going to
have many adventures. Only, of course, he did
not know that just now.</p>

<p>Poor Don was very tired, quite hungry and
very dirty, for the floor of the freight car had no
clean straw on it as had the dog kennel at the
farm. In fact Don did not look like a nice dog
at all. But he did not know this, for he had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
looking glass to tell him. I very much doubt
if dogs use mirrors,—don’t you? Anyhow,
Don did not feel like himself. He was beginning
to be more and more sorry every minute
that he had run away.</p>

<p>“But, as long as I have, I must make the best
of it,” thought Don. “And the first thing to do
is to get something to eat.”</p>

<p>He trotted over the railroad tracks, and soon
found himself running along the streets of a big
city. He had never been in such a large one before,
though once he had gone to a small one,
not far from the farm, with Bob and the farmer.
But this was a very big city, and Don had not a
friend in it. He sniffed and smelled, as he ran
along, trying to find something to eat. At last
he smelled meat, and oh! how hungry it made
him. He ran toward the smell, but, just as he
turned the corner near it, he heard a voice cry:</p>

<p>“Oh, look at that dog! Let’s throw a stone at
him!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>DON AND THE CAN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Don looked around quickly to see who
had spoken. He saw two boys standing
at the corner, near where that good smell
of meat came from, for which Don was so hungry.
One of the boys had stooped to pick up a
stone.</p>

<p>“Come on, Bill,” said this boy. “Get yourself
a stone and we’ll see who of us can hit that
dog first.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want to,” answered the other
boy. “What’s the good of hitting him?”</p>

<p>“To make him run. Come on.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want to. What’s the use of hurting
a dog? I like dogs. I wonder if I could
take that one home with me?”</p>

<p>Don had two kinds of feelings just then. One
was sort of an angry feeling at the boy who
wanted to throw a stone at him, and the other
feeling was a kind, glad one, toward the other
boy.</p>

<p>“That boy looks something like my little master,
Bob,” thought Don. “I’d like to go to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
for I think he would give me something to eat.
And oh! how hungry I am.”</p>

<p>Don wagged his tail. This was for the good
boy. Then Don growled, the least little bit.
That was for the bad boy. It was as if Don had
said to the good boy:</p>

<p>“I like you. I want to be friends with you.
You and I can have good times together.”</p>

<p>And when Don growled, it was as though he
had said to the bad boy:</p>

<p>“Come now! None of that—no throwing of
stones. That isn’t nice. I can’t be friends with
you if you throw stones at me.”</p>

<p>Of course neither of the boys understood Don’s
kind of talk. The dog was just going to go
closer to the boy who did not want to throw a
stone at him, when, all of a sudden the “bad”
boy, as I call him, threw the piece of rock, and
it hit Don on the leg.</p>

<p>“Wow! Ouch! Yelp!” cried poor Don, as
he limped away.</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed the boy who had thrown
the stone. “Look at him go! I knew I could
make him run!”</p>

<p>“Aw, what’d you want to go and do that for?”
asked the other boy, quickly. “Now I can’t get
him.”</p>

<p>“Well, he wasn’t much good,” spoke the boy
who had thrown the stone. “Let him go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“Guess I’ll have to,” said the good boy. “But
I wish you hadn’t hit him.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” thought Don, who heard this talk
as he limped away. “I don’t see why he wanted
to throw a stone at me.”</p>

<p>And I do not see why myself, except that some
boys do things without thinking. I do not believe
boys ever want really to be cruel and
mean, as they are when they stone dogs and cats.
It is just that they do not think.</p>

<p>Don ran on, and, after a while, his leg, that
had been hit by the stone, did not hurt him so
much. His feeling of hunger, which had gone
away for a little while, after he was hit, came
back again worse than before.</p>

<p>“I <em>must</em> find something to eat,” thought Don.
“I’ll get so weak that I’ll fall down in the street,
if I don’t eat.”</p>

<p>So, with his nose, he sniffed and snuffed until,
once more, he caught the smell of meat. Of
course dogs can look for food, but their noses
are sharper than their eyes, and they can smell
something good to eat long before they can see
it.</p>

<p>Other animals do, too. You just watch your
cat some time. She may see a wagon coming
down the street, but she does not pay any attention
to it because it is only a wagon from the
drygoods store.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Then another wagon comes down the street.
It looks almost like the one from the drygoods
store, but as soon as pussy sees that, she meows,
and runs to meet it. For this is the fish wagon,
and she can smell the fish in it before you can.
Cats like fish.</p>

<p>It was that way with Don. And once more
he smelled meat. This time he followed the
smell to a can that stood on the edge of the gutter.
It was an ash can, but in it was a piece of meat.</p>

<p>Don reached in, and grabbed it out as quickly
as he could, running around the corner, for he
had not forgotten the time a stone was thrown at
him when he took a bone from a yard.</p>

<p>The meat was not as clean and as nice as Don
would have gotten at his kennel at the farm, but
he was so hungry that he did not stop to think of
that. He ate the meat up at once.</p>

<p>“My, that tasted good!” said Don to himself.
“I wish I could find another piece like that.
And to think I wouldn’t look twice at such a
piece of meat at home. Well, running away is
certainly a strange life! I’ll never do it again,
and I’m going to run home as soon as I can.”</p>

<p>It was easier to say this than to do it. Don
was far, far from the nice farm, and he did not
even know which way to start to get back there.</p>

<p>My! what a noisy place the city was. Trolley
cars and automobiles raced through the streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and there were many horses and wagons. And
so many persons were hurrying here, there and
everywhere.</p>

<p>Poor Don was very lonesome. He finished
the last scrap of meat he had pulled out of the
ash can, and walked on. He did not know
where he was going, or what to do, but every
one in the city seemed to keep moving, so Don
did the same.</p>

<p>Don came to a street where there were many
wagons, cars and automobiles. On the other
side of the street he saw a butcher shop, with nice
meat hanging in the window.</p>

<p>“Now,” thought Don, “if I could only get
over there I might get a nice bone, or a scrap of
clean meat. Guess I’ll try it.”</p>

<p>He watched his chance, for he was afraid of
being run over, there were so many wagons and
autos in the street. At last Don thought he saw
an opening, and he darted forward.</p>

<p>But Don was not used to city ways. No
sooner was he half way across the street than it
seemed as if a dozen cars were rushing down
on him. A policeman shouted at him, and blew
a whistle.</p>

<p><a href="#i_p081">“Get out of there, dog!” cried the policeman.</a></p>

<p>Don started to run back, but, as he did so two
automobiles came past, with tooting horns, and
he was afraid of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go on! Go on!” cried the policeman. So
Don kept on across the street. He was almost
at the other curb, when another auto came along
so swiftly that one of the wheels hit Don, and
knocked him down. But the man steering the
automobile turned it out of the way just in time,
and Don was saved. He scrambled to the sidewalk,
his heart beating very fast.</p>

<p>“Well, well! That was a narrow escape you
had!” said a voice in his ear, and, looking up,
Don saw another dog. This dog was what we
should call a “tramp” dog. But he spoke kindly
to Don.</p>

<p>“You came near being run over,” said this dog,
wagging his tail.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess I did,” agreed Don.</p>

<p>“What’s your name, and where do you live?”
asked the tramp dog, wagging his tail some
more, to show that he was friendly.</p>

<p>“My name is Don,” said Bob’s pet, “and I
did live on a farm. But I ran away, to have
some adventures, and—”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’ll take my advice you’ll run back
to that farm as fast as you can,” said the tramp
dog. “I lived on one once, and it is much nicer,
for dogs, than the city. You’d better go back.”</p>

<p>“I would, if I could, but I can’t find my way,”
sorrowfully said Don, and he told of having
been locked in a freight car.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82-<br />83]</a></span></p>

<p>“My! You certainly have had some adventures,”
said the city dog, who had mentioned
that his name was Jack. “Have you had anything
to eat?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I found a piece of meat in a can,” answered
Don. “But it was not very good. It
was covered with ashes, and—”</p>

<p>“Well, you were lucky to get that,” said Jack.
“I haven’t had a thing to-day, and I’m almost
starved. You’ll be very glad to get even scraps
from ash cans if you stay in the city long, let me
tell you—very lucky indeed. I wish I could
find some now.”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you where the can is,” offered Don,
kindly. “But I don’t think there is any more
meat in it.”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” agreed Jack. “There are too many
dogs about to eat it.”</p>

<p>“There’s lots of meat in there,” said Don, looking
at the butcher shop. “Maybe they’ll give
us some.”</p>

<p>“Not much they won’t!” cried Jack. “All
the meat we’ll get there wouldn’t keep a kitten
from starving. We’ll have to hunt our own.
But come along. Maybe I’ll have some luck,
now I’ve met you. Have you any place to sleep
to-night?”</p>

<p>“No. But at home, on the farm, I had a nice
kennel, filled with soft straw,” said Don.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll find nothing like that here,” said Jack.
“Such things are only for rich dogs, with homes.
But never mind. I have a good sleeping place
under some boards in a lumber yard. I’ll take
you there to-night, and we’ll sleep together.”</p>

<p>“That is very good of you,” said Don. “And
if I find anything to eat, I’ll give you half.”</p>

<p>The two dogs looked longingly at the meat in
the butcher shop. In the window sat a fat cat,
and it seemed as though she blinked her eyes at
the dogs. She was not afraid of them.</p>

<p>“Just think of it!” cried Jack. “That cat has
all the meat she wants, and we have to be glad of
even scraps from an ash can.”</p>

<p>“Well, it serves me right for running away,”
thought Don to himself.</p>

<p>He and Jack managed to find a little meat that
day, but it was not much. They drank from a
mud puddle, and were glad enough to do so.
Then, worn out, tired and dusty, that night Jack
and Don went to the lumber yard to sleep.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you any cushions, or anything like
that?” asked Don, as he saw a space under some
bare boards, which Jack said was the bed.</p>

<p>“Nothing like that,” said Jack, with a bark.
“I’m glad enough to have a sheltered place, without
cushions.”</p>

<p>Poor Don was so tired that he fell asleep almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
at once. And he dreamed that he was back
in his kennel at the farm, lying in the warm
straw, and that in front of him was a big bowl
of milk and a plate of juicy bones.</p>

<p>Dogs and cats, as well as other animals, do
dream, I believe. If you ever watch sleeping
cats or dogs, you will often see them jump or
twitch, when their eyes are closed. And sometimes
they will whine or howl, just as children
talk in their sleep. Of course no one knows
what dogs and cats dream about, but I imagine
it must often be of good things to eat, don’t you?</p>

<p>At any rate Don dreamed of being back home,
but when he suddenly awakened he remembered
where he was.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m under the lumber pile,” Don thought
to himself. “And I’ll have to go hunting in ash
cans for something to eat. Oh, I wish I were
back home again! No more running away for
me!”</p>

<p>Then Don began to feel something queer on
his tail. It was as though it were being pinched.
He looked up, thinking perhaps Jack was doing
this to awaken him. But Jack was not to be
seen. And then Don saw something else.</p>

<p>Tied around his tail was a piece of rope that
had not been there when he went to sleep the
night before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Don jumped up quickly, and, as he did so, he
heard a rattling sound. At the same time a
boy’s voice cried:</p>

<p>“Hey, Jimmie! The dog’s woke up! Now
we’ll see some fun!”</p>

<p>Don sprang out from under the pile of boards.
As he did so, the rattlety-bang sound followed
him. It went wherever he went and, as he
looked around, he saw that a big tin can was
tied to his tail. Don did not know what to
make of it. Nothing like that had ever happened
to him before. He gave a jump, and ran
around the lumber yard. At every step the can
followed, with a rattle and bang.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is terrible!” yelped poor Don, as he
ran faster and faster. But, no matter how fast
he ran, the can on his tail followed.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>DON AND THE DOG CATCHER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Look at him run!” cried one of the boys
who had tied the tin can on Don’s tail,
when the dog was asleep. “Look!”</p>

<p>“He certainly can go!” shouted the other boy.
“Let’s see if we can’t catch him!”</p>

<p>But Don was running too fast for any small
boy to get hold of him, and those boys were not
very large. Don was running as he had never
run before, because he was so frightened.
Never before had he had a can tied to his tail,
and it bumped along after him, making such a
noise, and the rope pinched him so that, altogether,
Don was very much frightened.</p>

<p>But it was only “fun” for the boys. They
laughed and shouted to see Don try to get rid
of the tin can.</p>

<p>For, after the first few minutes, Don did try
to get rid of that bouncing, rattlety-bang thing
that seemed to follow him so closely. The dog
sat down, and, turning around, tried to pull the
rope off his tail by his teeth. But the boys had
tied it on too tightly to allow Don to get rid of
it easily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come on! Now we can catch him!” cried
one of the boys, as he saw Don sitting down near
a pile of shingles.</p>

<p>The two boys went softly up toward the dog.
I do not know what they would have done with
him if they had caught him, but they did not get
their hands on Don.</p>

<p>He stopped gnawing at the rope long enough
to look up, and he saw the boys. With a yelp,
a growl and whine, all together, Don sprang up
and ran on again.</p>

<p>“There he goes!” cried one of the boys.</p>

<p>“Yes. Head him off! You go one way, and
I’ll go the other,” shouted the second boy.
“Then we’ll get him, sure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a lot of trouble I’m having!”
thought poor Don. “How I wish I were back
on the farm! And I wish Jack, that shaggy dog,
was here to help me. I wonder where he went
to?”</p>

<p>But Jack was far away, and Don had to fight
his battle alone. Finally, as he was running
around with the can on his tail, Don saw a little
hole in the pile of lumber.</p>

<p>“If I can only crawl in there,” he said, “I’ll
hide from those boys. They can’t get at me in
there.”</p>

<p>Don made a dive for the hole. It was just
large enough to let him crawl in. He hoped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
tin can might catch on something and be pulled
off his tail. But it did not. Inside his hiding
place the can followed poor Don.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” thought the tired and panting
dog, “if the can had caught on something, and
if I pulled too hard, I might pull my tail off
also, and that would be too bad.” And of course
it would. You know that, as well as I do, without
me telling you.</p>

<p>“But maybe when Jack comes back, and these
boys go away, I’ll be able to get rid of this old
tin can,” thought Don. “Maybe Jack can help
me gnaw it off.”</p>

<p>So Don crept farther back into the hole, under
the lumber and the boys could not get at
him. They tried to, but they could not. They
even poked sticks in the hole, and threw stones
in, but none of them hit Don.</p>

<p>Finally, one of the men who owned the lumber
yard came out of his office, and saw the boys
bothering Don. The man called to them:</p>

<p>“Hi there, you little fellows! Run away, and
play somewhere else.”</p>

<p>Then the boys ran away, and left Don alone.
The man did not know there was a dog hiding
under his lumber pile. But Don felt very
kindly toward the man who had driven away the
boys.</p>

<p>“Now if he would only help me get rid of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
can on my tail I’d be all right,” thought Don.
“I wonder where Jack is?”</p>

<p>For some time Don stayed hiding under the
lumber pile. His heart was not beating so fast
now, though his tail still hurt him, where the can
was tied on. And he was hungry and thirsty,
for he had eaten nothing since the night before.
Don was just thinking it would be safe to come
out of his hiding place, when he heard a dog
barking. And he knew, at once, that it was his
shaggy friend Jack.</p>

<p>Though Jack’s voice would have sounded to
you and me only like: “Bow wow wow!” to
Don it said:</p>

<p>“Where are you? What has happened?
Where are you hiding?”</p>

<p>“Bow wow!” answered Don. “Here I am.
Oh, where have you been? Such a lot has happened
since you went away, and left me sleeping.
There is a can tied to my tail.”</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” said Jack to Don, as the latter
crawled out. “You have had a lot of trouble,
haven’t you? Never mind, I’ll soon have that
off your tail.” And he did, gnawing the rope
with his sharp teeth.</p>

<p>“Now I have a bone for you,” went on Jack.
“I left it in the place where we slept. It isn’t a
very good one, but it’s the best one I could find
this morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, that’s a fine bone,” said Don, when he
was hungrily gnawing it. At home he would
hardly have looked twice at such a bone, for it
had very little meat on it. But since he had run
away he was glad enough to get almost anything.</p>

<p>“Where did you go?” asked Don of Jack, as
the bone was finished, and Don began to feel
thirsty.</p>

<p>“Oh, seeing that you were soundly asleep, I
went out to look for breakfast,” answered Jack.
“I did not think the boys would find you asleep.
We must look for a new hiding place, since they
know where this one is. Now we’ll see if it’s
all right to go get a drink, down at the river. It
isn’t far.”</p>

<p>Jack looked out, but, almost at once, he drew
in his head again.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“There’s a man out there,” explained Jack.
“I don’t want him to see us, or he might chase
us.”</p>

<p>Don looked, and when he saw the man he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Why, he’s a good man. He drove away the
boys who were throwing stones at me.”</p>

<p>“Then he didn’t know you were there,” said
Jack, “for he doesn’t like dogs, and he won’t
have them in this lumber yard. We must wait
until he goes away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>So, though Don would have liked to go up to
the man, and be patted on the head, he thought
perhaps Jack knew best.</p>

<p>“Things are so different in the city from the
country,” said Don, with a dog-sigh.</p>

<p>“Indeed they are,” barked Jack.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the man went out of the lumber
yard, and then Jack and Don could go down to
the edge of the river, near the piles of boards,
and get a drink of cool water.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s fine!” cried Don. “That’s the best
water I’ve had since I ran away.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is good,” agreed Jack. “That’s why
I have a place near it. We can’t always get all
we want to eat in the city, but water is not so
hard to find. Now let’s go and hunt up our
dinner.”</p>

<p>“But we just had breakfast,” said Don.</p>

<p>“I know we did,” spoke Jack, as he washed his
face with his paw, “but we may have to hunt a
long time for something more to eat, and then it
will be dinner time.”</p>

<p>Once more Don thought how very different
this was from his farm kennel.</p>

<p>There, after he had had his breakfast, he could
play around, or perhaps drive in a runaway pig,
or go after the sheep or cows. He did not have
to worry about his dinner, for he knew Bob, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
some one, would bring it to him. But now Don
had to go out and look for a bone in an ash can.
Oh, it was very different!</p>

<p>This day Don and Jack were lucky. Together,
as they ran about the city streets, they
found a large piece of meat, which some cook
had thrown out at the back door of a house.</p>

<p>“Oh, this will be fine!” cried Jack. “We’ll
take this to the lumber yard, and put it in a new
hiding place. There will be enough for dinner
and supper too.”</p>

<p>It was not a very good piece of meat, being old
and tough, but it was just as good to those dogs
as roast turkey would be to you.</p>

<p>Jack took the meat in his mouth, and started
off with it.</p>

<p>“Keep a watch out for other dogs,” he said to
Don. “They may try to take it away from us.
And, if they do, drive them off.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Don. And he had to, several
times. But Don was now a big dog, and he was
braver and bolder than ever before. So, when
two or three dogs ran up, Don growled and
showed his sharp teeth, so that the other dogs
were glad enough to run away.</p>

<p>Jack picked out a new place under a pile of
lumber, and there he and Don ate their dinner.
They were feeling much better now, for there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
was enough meat left for their supper. And
they could always get plenty of clean drinking
water in the river.</p>

<p>“Oh, running away isn’t so bad, after all,” said
Don that night, after the last of the meat had
been eaten. “I am beginning to like it, now.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” advised Jack. “This is only the beginning.
Not always will we have such good
luck as we had to-day.”</p>

<p>Jack was right. The next day they could find
nothing to eat until late in the afternoon. Then
it was only a small bone which they divided between
them.</p>

<p>It rained, too, and the water ran down through
the lumber pile and got the dogs wet.</p>

<p>But Don could not find his way home, having
traveled so far in the freight car. He tried to
get back to Bob, but he could not, and Jack could
not help him.</p>

<p>For several weeks Jack and Don lived together
in the lumber pile, eating what and when
they could. Sometimes other dogs would fight
them, and try to take away their bones, but Jack
and Don were both strong, and usually they kept
what they found.</p>

<p>Don could go off by himself now, to find food,
and one day, as he was off thus, searching in
different ash cans, he had a sad adventure.</p>

<p>He had just found a nice bone, in some clean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
ashes, and was wiping it off on the grass, when
he saw two men running toward him. One of
them had a long net, on a pole, like the net Bob
used for catching fish, and Don wondered what
this was for. He soon found out.</p>

<p>“There’s a stray dog!” cried one of the men.
“Get him, and we’ll take him away!” And the
dog-catcher ran straight for Don.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>DON’S NEW FRIEND</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Poor Don did not know what to make of
all this. But, somehow, he felt that he
was in danger, and, with one more glance
back over his shoulder, seeing the man with the
net on the long pole still running after him,
Don ran also—and faster than ever.</p>

<p>“This is queer,” thought Don. “I wonder what
makes that man chase me? And does he think
I am a fish, that he tries to catch me in a net?”</p>

<p>But these men were not fishing for fish—they
were fishing for dogs, and Don did not know
what would happen if they caught him, so he ran
faster and faster.</p>

<p>Those men, you see, were hired to catch stray
dogs that were not allowed to run loose about
the streets in summer. The people feared the
stray dogs would go mad and bite them, so they
hired men, with wagons and nets, to catch them.</p>

<p>Once the dogs were caught they would be put
in a pen, called a “pound,” and if, after a certain
time, the dog’s master did not come and take him
away, the poor dog would be killed. That is
what they do to stray dogs in the city.</p>

<p>Of course Don did not know all this, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
his friend Jack had told him to be careful as he
went about the streets. So now Don felt there
was some danger, and on and on he ran, as fast
as he could run.</p>

<p>Somehow, Don could not run as fast and as
far as he used to. On the farm, when he raced
with Bob, Don always beat. But since he had
run away, Don had not had as good things to eat
as he had had on the farm. And he had not had
as good a place to sleep in. So Don was not as
strong and healthful as he had been.</p>

<p>“Why, I’m getting tired!” panted poor Don,
as he raced on. He looked back over his shoulder.
The man with the net was coming closer.
There was another man following, with a big,
black wagon.</p>

<p>“Can you get him?” asked the man, driving
the black wagon.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll have him in a minute!” cried the
man with the net. “That will make the wagon
full, and we’ll take ’em all to the pound.”</p>

<p>“You’ll never take me there—not if I can
help it!” thought Don.</p>

<p>He ran on, his red tongue hanging out of his
mouth, and his breath coming in gasps. He was
thirsty, too, but he saw no place to get a drink.
Even if there had been a puddle of water, Don
would not have dared stop to lap up any, for
the dog catcher was close to him, coming on and
on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh dear!” thought Don. “This is terrible!
How much better I would have been had I
stayed on the farm. No more running away for
me.”</p>

<p>But Don was not at the end of his adventures,
even yet.</p>

<p>He gave one more glance backward, to see
how close the man with the net was to him, and
then something happened. Don stepped on a
sharp piece of glass in the street, and cut his
foot, not badly, but enough to make him limp.
And then he could not run so fast. The piece
of glass must have stuck in his foot, for Don
could not step on it without its hurting him very
much. He had to run on three legs.</p>

<p>Now a dog cannot run as fast on three legs as
he can on four, and Don had to go slower and
slower.</p>

<p>“Now you can get him!” cried the man on the
wagon.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll have him now,” shouted the man
with the net.</p>

<p>Don tried to run on faster, but it was of no
use. In a few minutes more he felt something
hit him on the head. Then <a href="#i_p099">he was all tangled
up in the meshes of the net, and he fell down</a>,
hurting his cut foot more than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<div id="i_p099" class="figcenter" style="width: 353px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100-<br />101]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now I have you!” cried the man with the
net. He picked up Don, and, as the wagon
came up, tossed him into it. Instantly there was
a chorus of barks and growls, for there were
many other dogs in the wagon, and they did not
seem to like Don.</p>

<p>“Who’s coming in here now?” growled one of
the dogs in the catcher’s wagon.</p>

<p>“Yes; weren’t we crowded enough already?”
asked another.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it doesn’t make much difference,”
snarled a third dog. “We’ll soon have room
enough in the pound.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to bother you,” said Don, thinking
it best to make friends with the stray dogs, “but
I did not come in here of my own accord. I
was—”</p>

<p>“Thrown in!” interrupted a little, white
poodle dog in one corner of the wagon. “That’s
it—you were thrown in—I saw you!”</p>

<p>“That is right, I was thrown in,” said Don.
“I’d gladly go out, if I could, and make more
room for you, but I can’t,” and he looked at the
dogs and the tightly closed door.</p>

<p>“No, you can’t get out,” growled the yellow
dog who had said there would be more room
soon. “We’ll just have to crowd up a little
closer, that’s all. But we’ll soon have plenty of
room to move about.”</p>

<p>“You said that before,” spoke the little poodle
dog. “How do you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because I have been there,” was the answer.
“I was caught once before, just as I was this
time, and taken to the pound. But a boy came
and bought me, so I was allowed to go.”</p>

<p>I forgot to tell you that sometimes people who
want a dog go to the pound, pick one out of
those that have been caught, and buy it, taking
it away to give it a good home.</p>

<p>“I hope some one buys me,” thought Don. “I
don’t like this life, living like a tramp, with no
good place to sleep, and no nice things to eat.”</p>

<p>The wagon rumbled on to the city pound,
and there the dogs were allowed to go out, and
run about in a yard, all fenced in with wire.
There were many other dogs there, little ones
and big ones, nice ones, and some that were not
so nice. Some of them snarled and barked, and
some tried to get out, but could not.</p>

<p>“Oh dear!” cried one little poodle dog, whose
silken hair showed that he was used to a good
home. “Oh dear! I don’t like it here. Oh,
stop!” he cried, as a bigger dog tried to bite
him.</p>

<p>“Here, you let him alone!” growled Don to
the big dog.</p>

<p>“Why should I let him alone?” asked the big
dog, growling and showing his teeth.</p>

<p>“Because he’s a friend of mine,” said Don.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” answered the bad dog, “in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
case it’s different. I didn’t know he was a friend
of yours. Of course I’ll let him alone.”</p>

<p>“You’d better,” growled Don. Of course the
little dog was not really a friend of Don’s, for
he had never seen him before, but Don thought
it best to speak that way, for he did not want to
see the little dog hurt.</p>

<p>And when the bad dog had gone off in a
corner of the pound, the little silky poodle, who
had been in the same wagon with Don, came up
to him, and said:</p>

<p>“It was very kind of you to take my part that
way. I am very much obliged to you. It was
nice to tell him I was your friend,” and he
wagged his tail in a friendly fashion.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Don, as he limped
to a shady place to lie down.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>DON AT A PARTY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The little silky poodle dog followed Don,
for the dogs in the pound were not very
friendly toward one another—at least
most of them were not. You would have
thought, being all in trouble together, that they
would be friendly and kind, but the big dogs
picked on the little ones, and the little ones
snarled at the big ones, until there was so much
noise that it sounded like a dozen dog fights going
on at once.</p>

<p>But Don and the little poodle dog did not
quarrel. They seemed to be good friends from
the start.</p>

<p>“Oh, have you hurt your foot?” asked the
poodle of Don.</p>

<p>“Yes, I stepped on some glass when the man
with the net was chasing me,” said Don.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too bad,” the other dog said. “I’m
so sorry. If you were at my house, now, my
little mistress would put some salve and a rag
on your foot, and it would soon be well. Oh
dear! I wonder if ever I’ll see her again?” he
sighed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“See whom?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“My little mistress. I belong to a little girl,”
the poodle explained.</p>

<p>“Why did you run away from her?” asked
Don.</p>

<p>“Run away? I didn’t!” cried the silky
poodle. “I went out on the front steps to get a
breath of fresh air this morning, and when I
stood there a bad boy came along, picked me up,
and ran off with me. He wanted to take me
away, and sell me. I’ve often been stolen that
way,” said the poodle. “I’m a very valuable
dog, you know.”</p>

<p>“You really have been stolen, and carried
away?” asked Don, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered the poodle. “Then my
little mistress, or her father, would put an advertisement
in the paper, saying that whoever
had taken me away could have some money if I
were brought back, and I would then be taken
home.</p>

<p>“So when this boy grabbed me up off the stoop
I thought I was stolen again. But a policeman
saw the boy take me, and the policeman ran after
him. So the boy dropped me and ran, and I
got lost, trying to find my way home again.
Then the dog-catcher came and took me in his
wagon. Oh dear! It’s too bad. Were you
ever taken away like that?” he asked Don.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” answered Don. “I ran away.”</p>

<p>“Ran away!” exclaimed the poodle. “Why
did you do that? Didn’t they treat you kindly?
Did they whip you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Don. “My master, Bob, was
very kind to me. I was never whipped. But
I wanted to have some adventures, so I ran
away.”</p>

<p>“Did you have any adventures?” asked the
poodle, whose name was Rex.</p>

<p>“Many of them,” replied Don. “This is one.
I wonder if we shall ever get out of here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think so,” answered the poodle. “My
little mistress, or her father, is sure to come looking
for me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish some one would come for me,
or that I could find my way back to the farm,”
said Don, sadly enough. “I’d never run away
again—never!”</p>

<p>It was not at all nice in the dog pound. There
was water to drink, but it was not clean, and it
was very warm, for the sun shone on it all day
long. And there was hardly anything to eat.</p>

<p>Once in a while some scraps of food were
thrown in to the dogs, but there were so many
of them, and they were so fierce and strong, the
most of them, that little dogs, like Rex, and lame
dogs, like Don, got nothing at all.</p>

<p>“And I am so hungry!” whined Rex. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
would just like to have some nice chicken bones
now, wouldn’t you, Don?”</p>

<p>“I’d be glad to have even a dry crust of
bread,” said Don, sadly.</p>

<p>His foot pained him more than ever now, and
he could walk about only a little, and very
slowly.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry for you,” said Rex. “When
my little mistress comes for me I know she’ll
help you. Maybe she’ll take you home when
she takes me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t expect that,” said Don. “But
I would be glad if I were back in the hole in the
lumber pile, with my friend Jack. I thought
that was bad enough, after my nice kennel, but
I would be glad of it now.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to live that way,” said Rex.
“Did you have a blue silk cushion to sleep on,
when you were home?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” said Don, “but I had some nice, clean
straw. I like that better than a cushion. But
now I am going over and get some of that water.
Even if it is warm and muddy, I must drink it.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll have to take some, too,” said Rex.
“But I wish I had some nice, cool, clean water
out of my little white dish at home.”</p>

<p>Even dogs cannot have what they want, especially
if they run away, or get lost, so Don and
Rex had to make the best of what they could get.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Don, and his new friend Rex, had to stay in
the pound several days. Each day they liked
it less and less, for they grew hungrier and
hungrier. They saw several of the dogs taken
away by those who owned them, but no one came
for Rex, and of course no one came for Don.
For Bob did not know where his pet was, and
the little mistress of Rex did not seem to think
of looking in the pound for him.</p>

<p>Many, many times, in those days spent in the
pound, Don wished over and over again that he
had never run away from Bob.</p>

<p>“Those were happy days!” sighed Don.</p>

<p>He even wished for the time he had spent with
Jack, the stray dog. But Jack was more lucky
than Don—he had not been caught and taken
to the pound.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why some one doesn’t come for
me,” said Rex one day, as he and Don were
talking together in one corner of the pound.
Don’s foot was growing better now.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they may come to-day,” said Don.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” spoke Rex. “I need a bath very
much. I like to be clean. And I am so hungry
for a good meal, and for some nice food to eat,
and cold water to drink.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” Don said. “But I don’t believe
we shall get either, very soon.”</p>

<p>However, good luck was coming to Don and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Rex. It was the very same afternoon that they
saw the gate of the pound open, and the dog-catcher
come in. With him was another man
and a little girl.</p>

<p>“Here are some stray dogs,” said the pound-keeper.
“Maybe your pet is in here, little girl.”</p>

<p>Rex gave one look at the visitors, and then he
let out a joyful bark, and wagged his tail very
hard.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“There’s my little mistress come for me!”
barked Rex. “Now I’ll be taken home and
cared for.”</p>

<p>“I wish that was going to be my luck,” said
Don, sadly.</p>

<p>“Bow wow!” barked Rex, running up to the
little girl. She looked at him once, and then she
cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, father! Here he is! Here’s my own
Rex! I’ve found him again!” and, all dirty as
Rex was, the little girl picked him up in her
arms and hugged him tightly. Oh, how happy
Rex was!</p>

<p>“So that’s your dog?” asked the pound-keeper.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve found him!” cried the little girl,
happily.</p>

<p>“So it is Rex,” said her father. “I wonder
how he got here?”</p>

<p>“We found him on the street,” said the pound-keeper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
“and we have to pick up all stray dogs,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I know—yes,” said the little girl’s father.
“But now we’ll take Rex home with us, Alice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, father. And I must give him a
good wash. I think he is hungry, too. Look
how thin he is!”</p>

<p>“He must have had a hard time,” said the
man, patting Rex on the head. “I wonder what
has happened to him since he was taken away?”</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could only tell you!” thought Rex,
but of course he could not speak man or girl talk.
The little mistress of the silken poodle started
out of the pound with him in her arms. But this
did not suit Rex. He did not want to go away
from Don that way. Poor Don felt very sad
and alone, as he saw his little friend being taken
away, while he had to stay in the pound.</p>

<p>Rex struggled so hard, that the little girl had
to put him down.</p>

<p>“Why, Rex, what is it?” she asked. “Don’t
you want me to take you home, and away from
this place?”</p>

<p>“Bow wow!” barked Rex, which meant:
“Yes, thank you, of course I do. But I have a
friend here,” and he ran up to Don, and stood
so close to him that, in a minute, the little girl’s
father guessed what the little poodle dog meant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your pet has made a friend while in the
pound,” said the man. “See, Alice, he likes
that big dog.”</p>

<p>Then Rex took hold of the shaggy hair of
Don’s leg, for that was as far up as he could
reach, and he tried to pull Don toward Alice.</p>

<p>“Look!” exclaimed the little girl. “Oh,
father! I believe Rex wants us to take that
other dog with us!”</p>

<p>“It does look so,” spoke the man. “I guess
this big dog, whatever his name is, has been
kind to Rex.”</p>

<p>“Bow wow! Indeed he has!” barked Rex, but
of course Alice and her father could not understand
his talk. They did understand his actions,
however, for Rex did not seem to want to go
away without Don.</p>

<p>“Oh, father! Could we take him with us?”
asked Alice, as she patted Don on his big head.
He looked up at her with his big, kind brown
eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I suppose we could keep another
dog,” said the man. “Only he is so big he’d
have to stay out in the stable, with the horses.
You couldn’t have him in the house, as you do
Rex.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please let’s take him home!” begged
Alice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” answered her father with a
laugh. “We’ll take the big dog home too,” he
said to the pound-keeper.</p>

<p>“I am glad of it,” said the pound-keeper. “I
was sorry I had to bring that dog in, for he
looks as though he had been in a good home.
I’m glad you’re taking him.”</p>

<p>So Don was led out of the pound, and he
walked along beside the man, while Alice carried
Rex in her arms.</p>

<p>Outside the dog pound was a big automobile.
Alice and her father had come in that.</p>

<p>“See, James!” cried Alice to the chauffeur. “I
have Rex back again.”</p>

<p>“So I see,” spoke the chauffeur. “Hello,
Rex!” and he patted the poodle on the head, for
he knew him well.</p>

<p>“Bow wow!” barked Rex. Then to Don he
said: “Now we are all right. I’ll have my
blue silk cushion to sleep on, and we’ll both have
all we want to eat, and good water to drink.
Aren’t you glad to come home with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed I am—and thank you very
much,” said Don, in his dog talk, to Rex. “But
are we to ride in that auto?” he asked. “I never
have been in one, though once one almost ran
over me.”</p>

<p>“Of course we are to ride in it,” said Rex.
“I hardly ever walk. Jump in!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“If Squinty, the pig, could only see me now!”
thought Don, as he rode away with Rex.</p>

<p>The first thing that happened to Don and Rex,
when they got to the place where the poodle dog
lived, was that they each had a nice bath. Rex,
being so little, had his in the house, but Don got
his scrubbing out in the automobile garage, under
a hose. And oh! how good it felt—the cool
water splashing on him. Then he was dried in
the warm sun, and given a good meal.</p>

<p>“Now I am happy again,” thought Don.
“But still I would like to go back to the farm,
and my little master Bob.”</p>

<p>For several weeks Don lived in the barn back
of the house where Rex had his home. Sometimes
Don was taken into the house, and allowed
to play with Rex, for Rex was very fond of his
big dog friend. And often Rex came out to the
barn.</p>

<p>One day Alice came out to the barn with a red
ribbon in her hand.</p>

<p>“James, where is Don?” she asked the
chauffeur.</p>

<p>“What do you want with him, Miss Alice?”
asked the man who steered the auto.</p>

<p>“I want to tie this red ribbon on his neck, to
make him look pretty,” she answered. “I am
having a party this afternoon, and I want Don
to come to it a little while, and do some of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
tricks. He can do more tricks than can Rex.
Oh, there you are, Don!” cried Alice, as she saw
the big dog. “Come and have a nice ribbon tied
on you, and then you may come to the party!”
she said.</p>

<p>When the bow was fastened on his neck, Don
was led into the house to the party. And a very
wonderful thing happened there.</p>

<small>DON AND THE BEAR</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Don did not know very much about parties—especially
girls’ parties. On the
farm there had never been any parties,
except for boys, and those were mostly fishing,
or nutting parties. Don never wore any ribbons
to those.</p>

<p>This party that Alice gave was quite different.
Don was led into the parlor, and he saw many
little girls sitting about, all wearing white
dresses, with sashes of different colored ribbons.</p>

<p>Some of the sashes were almost as large as the
little girls themselves.</p>

<p>On the other side of the room were the boys,
and they wore black suits and large white collars.</p>

<p>“Ah ha!” thought Don. “It must be Sunday,
the reason they are all dressed up so nicely.
And that’s why I have to wear a red ribbon.
Yes, it must be Sunday.”</p>

<p>On the farm, you see, Don had seen Bob, and
the others, put on different clothes for Sunday,
and he thought it was that way now. But it was
only Alice’s party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, what a lovely big dog!” cried the girls,
as Alice led Don in. “Is he yours?”</p>

<p>“We found him in the pound,” answered
Alice. “And he can do tricks, too.”</p>

<p>Alice had found this out soon after bringing
Don to her home, and she and her father had
put the dog through all the tricks that he could
perform.</p>

<p>“Hello, Don!” cried Rex, who was lying on a
blue silk cushion. “You want to behave your
prettiest now, old chap! This is a party, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Don, barking softly. He was
afraid to bark too loudly, for fear of knocking
down some of the vases from the mantel.</p>

<p>“Now, Don!” said Alice, “show the girls and
boys how you stand up on your hind legs.”</p>

<p>Don kindly did this trick for Alice, as he had
been used to doing it for Bob. Then he did
others, and the boys and girls clapped their
hands and laughed.</p>

<p>Then, when <a href="#i_frontis">Don had finished his trick of
marching around like a soldier dog, with the
broom for a gun</a>, a boy, larger than any of the
others at the party, came into the parlor. As
soon as Alice saw him she ran up to him, crying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<div id="i_p117" class="figcenter" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/i_p117.jpg" width="351" height="600" alt="" title="" />
<br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_118">“It’s my dog, Don, that ran away from the farm a long
while ago!”</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118-<br />119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Cousin Bob! I was afraid you couldn’t
come, you live so far off in the country. But
I’m awfully glad you came to my party.”</p>

<p>“So am I glad, Cousin Alice,” said the big boy.
“I came on the train. I wouldn’t miss one of
your parties for anything! Why you have a
new dog!” he exclaimed, as he saw Don.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Alice, “I got him out of the
pound, where they had taken Rex, and—”</p>

<p>Then Alice suddenly stopped talking, for her
cousin Bob, who had come all the way from the
country to her birthday party, stood looking at
Don in a queer way. And Don was looking at
Bob.</p>

<p>“Why—why—” began Bob. “That dog—he
looks just like—why I believe <a href="#i_p117">it’s my dog, Don,
that ran away from the farm a long while ago!”</a>
he cried. “It’s Don!”</p>

<p>Don was barking now. He did not care how
many vases he jarred from the mantel.</p>

<p>“Bow wow!” he barked. “Of course I’m
Don, and you’re my master Bob. I know you!”</p>

<p>He sprang toward the boy, and, rising up,
put his paws on Bob’s shoulder, licking his
master’s face and hands with his tongue.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!” cried the boys and girls. “It’s
another trick!”</p>

<p>“No, this isn’t a trick,” said Bob. “It’s just
that Don is glad to see me again, aren’t you, old
fellow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Don barked, whined, wagged his tail and tried
to do half a dozen things at once, he was so glad
to see Bob again.</p>

<p>And Bob was so glad to get his pet dog back
that he put his arms about his neck and hugged
him tightly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Don!” cried Bob. “Where have you
been all these weeks?”</p>

<p>Of course Don could not tell, and Bob could
only guess.</p>

<p>“And is he really your lost dog?” asked Alice
of Bob.</p>

<p>“He certainly is,” answered Bob, laughing.
“But it is the strangest thing to find him at your
party. Where did you get him?”</p>

<p>Then Alice told of how her pet Rex had been
taken away, and how she had found him in the
pound, and how Rex seemed to want Don to
come home with him.</p>

<p>“And so we brought him, and have kept him
ever since,” said Alice. “But of course you can
have him now, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Bob. So it turned out
that Don found his master again, in a very
strange way.</p>

<p>“And to think that I found Don this time!”
cried Bob. “We missed him so at the farm.
Squinty, the pig, runs out of his pen very often,
and Don was the only one who could get him
back. Yes, we need Don at the farm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you be glad to go back there, Don?”
asked Rex, for the two dogs understood something
of what was going on.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I shall be glad to get back,”
answered Don. “It was very nice here, of
course,” he said, “and I like you very much, but
I need room to run about. Some day I hope you
will come to the country and see me.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I shall,” said Rex. “If I come I
shall probably come in the automobile, though,
and sleep on my blue silk cushion. I am so
used to that.”</p>

<p>Then the party went on, Don doing more
tricks for Bob. And how the other boys and
girls laughed and clapped their hands!</p>

<p>“I wonder how I can get Don home?” said
Bob, when the party was over, after the children
had eaten ice cream and cake.</p>

<p>“You can ride to the farm in father’s automobile,”
said his cousin Alice, “and Don can
ride with you. That’s how we brought him
from the pound.”</p>

<p>“That will be a good way,” said Bob.</p>

<p>The next day, after Don had said good-by
to Rex, he was taken back to the farm in the
automobile.</p>

<p>“Well, this is certainly better than running
along on three legs,” thought Don, whose sore
foot was all well now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>When they were half-way to the farm the
automobile had to stop, because all the wind
came out of one of the big tires, and James, the
chauffeur man who steered the machine, had to
get out to put on a new tire.</p>

<p>While Bob and Alice, who rode with Bob,
carrying Rex in her arms, were waiting under
the shade of a tree beside the road, they heard
a bugle horn playing.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Alice. “Soldiers?”</p>

<p>“It sounds more like the horn of a fishman,”
said Bob.</p>

<p>But it was neither one. Don smelled a
strange, wild-animal smell in the air, like the
one coming from the circus passing along the
road, the day Squinty, the comical pig, had run
away. Then, around a bend in the road came
two men, one of them leading a big bear by a
chain, and the other carrying the horn.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a bear!” cried Alice. “I’m afraid!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” said Bob. “It’s only a
tame, trained bear.”</p>

<p>Don and Rex both barked at the bear, but, to
their surprise, the bear spoke to them in animal
language.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” the bear said, kindly. “I
won’t hurt any one. I’m only going to do some
tricks.” And when the men spoke to him, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
turned somersaults, marched around like a soldier,
with a wooden gun, and climbed a telegraph
pole.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a pretty good trick?” asked the
bear.</p>

<p>“It certainly is,” said Don. “I can do some
tricks, but I can’t climb telegraph poles.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can do other things, too,” said the bear.
“I have lots of fun going about the country with
my masters.”</p>

<p>And, in another book, to be called “Dido, the
Dancing Bear,” I shall tell you what happened
to the big, shaggy creature.</p>

<p>Soon the automobile tire was mended, and
away went Bob and Alice again, with Don and
Rex, leaving Dido, the bear, sitting on the grass
with the two men, eating a bun.</p>

<p>A little later Don was back on the farm again,
and every one was glad to see him after all his
adventures. And, as soon as he could, Don ran
out to see Squinty, the comical pig.</p>

<p>“Where in the world have you been, Don?”
asked Squinty.</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty nearly all over,” answered Don.
“Has anything happened here since I’ve been
gone?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was bought by a boy, and I ran away,
and I went up in a balloon, and I had many adventures,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
said Squinty. “But I was glad to
get back to the farm again.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Don. And then he went to
look for a juicy bone. And so we will say
good-by to Don, the runaway dog.</p>

<p>In all nursery literature animals have
played a conspicuous part; and the reason
is obvious, for nothing entertains a child
more than the antics of an animal. These
stories abound in amusing incidents such
as children adore, and the characters are
so full of life, so appealing to a child’s
imagination, that none will be satisfied until
they have met all of their favorites—Squinty,
Slicko, Mappo, and the rest.</p>
